The veteran actors met again on stage at the New York Comic-Con in October 2022. The videos from this impromptu emotional meeting have gone viral and garnered over 7 million views on social media. Reminiscing about their passion for films and going back in time, the legendary actors enthralled the audience with anecdotes from the set of sci-fi/comedy films. Let us look at their wonderful friendship that has stood the test of time.</p><p>Michael J. Fox replaced actor Eric Stoltz as Marty Mcfly in Back to the Future after the production had already shot a few scenes. Christopher Lloyd wasn't so happy about the re-shoot back then, but it's safe to say he's happy with Michael J. Fox joining production.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-j-fox-and-christopher-lloyd-were-complete-strangers-at-the-beginning><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Michael J.

Fox and Christopher Lloyd's story of friendship had an unusual beginning. During the shoot of the first installment of the film franchise <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Director Robert Zemeckis realized actor Eric Stoltz wasn't fit for the role</a> of a slacker teenager named Marty Mcfly. Production was already six weeks in, so there would be additional costs to re-shoot the scenes with a new actor. The director wanted someone with comic flare; hence Michael J. Fox was recommended for the role.</p><p>He had been busy filming the Family Ties television series. The five-time Emmy-winning actor was apprehensive at the beginning about taking up a part in a sci-fi film. On the other hand, Christopher Lloyd wasn’t too happy about the changes. He got wary that they would have to re-shoot the changes with a new actor. When the two finally met on the sets, there was instant chemistry, and the rest, as you know, is history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Michael J.

The two veteran actors became close friends only after filming two installments of the sci-fi franchise. On the sets of Back to the Future 3, they bonded over their passion for acting, books, and films.</p><p>During the recent New York Con stage event, Michael J. Fox described that he admired Christopher Llyod's acting skills and their lengthy discussions on Shakespeare’s "King Lear." He loved the fact that his best friend could explain scenes in the simplest of ways. Since acting was a priority for both, they guided each other in the right direction throughout the filming of the sci-fi/comedy franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christopher-lloyd-39-s-emotional-support-during-michael-j-fox-39-s-parkinson-rsquo-s-reveal><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Christopher Lloyd's Emotional Support During Michael J.

Fox had been harboring a deep medical health secret while working on the sets of Spin City (1996-2000). He had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 1991 but was dreading to announce the same publically. He lived in a state of self-denial for seven years while carrying out his professional commitments dutifully.</p><p>During these seven years of soul-searching, he was under constant mental stress and had turned alcoholic. Christopher Lloyd stood by him like a good friend during the struggle and also when he was ready to go public about his medical condition. Since the inception of The Michael J. Fox Foundation For Parkinson's Research, Lloyd has been the biggest supporter of the medical cause. Recently during a heartwarming reunion at the New York Con, Michael thanked his best friend with a hug for standing beside him like a rock all these years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-j-fox-and-christopher-lloyd-reunited-on-stage-after-36-years><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Michael J.
