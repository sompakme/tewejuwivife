The story of a blended family, we saw Carol and Mike join together with their kids, creating a family of six. Thankfully, Carol and Mike had kids that were all similar in age. We had Marcia and Greg as the eldest of the brood, Jan and Peter as the middle children, and Cindy and Bobby as the youngest.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Richest Actors in the World of 2019</a></span></p><p>As the five seasons charged on, we watched this family go through everything other families were going through. The difficulties of raising a blended family, kids growing up and wanting independence, boyfriend/girlfriend troubles â€” there was something so charming about them all.</p><p>Since it's been 45 years since the show wrapped up, we're taking a look at what some of our favorite characters look like today and remembering those who've passed on.</p><h2 id=mike-lookinland-bobby-brady>MIKE LOOKINLAND: BOBBY BRADY</h2><p>Mike Lookinland portrayed the youngest of the Brady crew, Bobby Brady. Bobby was adventurous, curious, and playful by nature. He also got along swimmingly with Cindy, who was similar in age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In comparison to other actors on the show, Mike didn't do too much after&nbsp;The Brady Bunch&nbsp;ended. He did the show's various spinoffs and a few TV movies but he's most known for his reoccurring role of Bobby. Today, Mike is 58, married, and has two children.</p><h2 id=susan-olsen-cindy-brady>SUSAN OLSEN: CINDY BRADY</h2><p>Susan Olsen played everyone's favorite little sister, Cindy Brady. She had an adorable baby face, blonde pigtails, and an endearing lisp that made her a TV legend.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Well-Paid Voice Actors</a></span></p><p>After&nbsp;The Brady Bunch&nbsp;ended, Susan stayed in the spotlight but ventured into graphic design, hosting, and becoming an author. She starred in a few of the show's spinoffs and different TV shows. Today, Susan is twice divorced, respectfully, and has one son.</p><h2 id=christopher-knight-peter-brady>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT: PETER BRADY</h2><p>Christopher Knight played Peter Brady, the middle child of the group. He was quite sensitive in comparison to Bobby or Greg and was equally clumsy. Nevertheless, viewers adored him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the show ended, Christopher also joined on to many of the show's spinoffs but he dabbled in other works as well. He also made a slight comeback thanks to his reality TV show with ex-wife Adrianne Curry. These days, Knight is married and just appeared on HGTV's A Very Brady Renovation.</p><h2 id=eve-plumb-jan-brady>EVE PLUMB: JAN BRADY</h2><p>Eve Plumb played the sweet Jan Brady. As the middle child, Jan was very jealous of her siblings' achievements, especially Marcia's. She was beautiful and smart but always compared herself to other people, which made her all the more relatable.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Kid Actors Ever</a></span></p><p>Today, Eve is still acting and even had roles on&nbsp;Army Wives,&nbsp;That '70s Show,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blue Bloods. She's been married since the late '90s and has spent her free time painting, which has been beautifully received.</p><h2 id=barry-williams-greg-brady>BARRY WILLIAMS: GREG BRADY</h2><p>Barry Williams portrayed everyone's favorite big brother, Greg. Greg was a young man who always thought he was more of a man than he actually was. He desperately wanted to be suave and mature and we all loved him for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barry went on to complete the various Brady Bunch spinoffs and is still acting today. At 65, he's married, has two children, and dabbles in music with a traveling singing group called&nbsp;Barry Williams and the Traveliers.</p><h2 id=maureen-mccormick-marcia-brady>MAUREEN MCCORMICK: MARCIA BRADY</h2><p>Maureen McCormick played the very beautiful and clever Marcia Brady. As the most popular girl in school, Marcia always had someone interested in her but it came with some backlash in the form of jealousy (especially with her sister Jan).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Famous Actors Who Are Fantastic Dancers</a></span></p><p>Like her other castmates, Maureen went on to do the show's spinoffs and as she got older, she's been doing more reality television. In 2008, she penned a book&nbsp;<i>Here's the Story: Surviving Marcia Brady </i>and<i> Finding My True Voice</i>. Sadly, like many child actors, Maureen suffered addiction issues but has since become sober and is living happily with her husband.</p><h2 id=florence-henderson-carol-brady>FLORENCE HENDERSON: CAROL BRADY</h2><p>Florence Henderson played Carol Brady, America's favorite mom. She was protective, loyal, and caring of her family and made sure her "adopted" sons were seen as her own. She was also deeply in love with her husband Mike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, at the age of 82, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Florence</a> passed away suddenly on Thanksgiving Day due to heart failure. Four days before she passed on (surrounded by her family), she was supporting Maureen McCormick on Dancing with the Stars.</p><h2 id=robert-reed-mike-brady>ROBERT REED: MIKE BRADY</h2><p>Known as America's favorite dad, Robert Reed played Mike Brady. Mike always had wise words to share with his family and tried his best to raise independent and respectful young men.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Top 10 Richest Actresses In The World Of 2019</a></span></p><p>While Reed got along well with his castmates, he caused quite a stir with writers of his character. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thought</a> some of the storylines were silly or unrealistic was afraid this role would ruin his chance at other, more serious roles.</p><p>In the '90s, Reed sadly passed away from colon cancer.</p><h2 id=ann-b-davis-alice-nelson>ANN B. DAVIS: ALICE NELSON</h2><p>Ann B. Davis played the Bradys' loving and devoted housekeeper. She helped Carol and Mike raise the kids and kept their home nice and tidy. But before Ann took the role of Alice, she was known for her time on&nbsp;The Bob Cummings Show for which she won two Primetime Emmy Awards for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued acting through the '90s until she passed away in 2014 from a brain injury she received after falling. Today, she is still well-spoken for and missed by the&nbsp;Brady clan.</p><h2 id=allan-melvin-sam-franklin>ALLAN MELVIN: SAM FRANKLIN</h2><p>Allan Melvin portrayed Alice's longterm boyfriend (and local butcher) Sam Franklin. He was known for his quick jabs and funny puns with Alice and the Bradys.</p><p>But actor Allan Melvin was known for much more than his role as Sam. He was on&nbsp;<i>The Andy Griffith Show,</i>&nbsp;All in the Family,&nbsp;and did voice work for&nbsp;The Jetsons. In 2008, Allan sadly lost his battle to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cancer.</a></p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest-Earning Actresses From 2010 to 2019</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWiaopaxunnBrqWcoF2YrrTAjLCfnqqVYrC2vtGepa2kqWK9qq%2FTrqmeq18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-the-richest-braxton-sister.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is The Richest Braxton Sister?">&larr;
