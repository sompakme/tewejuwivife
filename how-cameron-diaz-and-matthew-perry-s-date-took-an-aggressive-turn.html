"Years ago, right after she quit seeing <strong><a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a></strong>, I got set up on a date with Cameron Diaz," Perry wrote in his memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.

Perry claimed that Diaz got “immediately stoned” during a group dinner party and “wasn’t interested in him at all." Cameron Diaz had been dating Timberlake between 2003 and 2007 before a very public split.</p><p>"But the party went on nevertheless, and at one point we were all playing a game — Pictionary, I think," Perry explained. "As she was drawing, I said something witty to Cameron, to which she said, 'Oh, come on!' and proceeded to punch me in the shoulder."</p><p>But the actress missed and actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">smacked the 17 Again actor in the face</a>. Perry explained that he was caught off guard and shocked by Diaz accidentally punching him. "'Are you f****** kidding me?' I said, realizing I'd just been punched in the face by Cameron Diaz, and my big arms hadn't helped at all," he recalled. The star previously explained he began working out around this era, and wore his sleeves rolled up to show off his muscles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cameron Diaz and Matthew Perry's relationship didn't go any further than this incident, and there wasn't a second date.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Former Friends Guest Star Admitted He Had A Hard Time Reading Matthew Perry's Memoir</a></span></p><h2 id=what-matthew-perry-39-s-relationship-with-julia-roberts-was-like>What Matthew Perry's Relationship With Julia Roberts Was Like</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-julia-roberts-forgive-matthew-perry-before-he-died_.jpg><p>In addition to sharing details about his "romantic" interaction with Cameron Diaz, Matthew Perry also opened up in his memoir about his romance with Julia Roberts.

The pair met when Roberts was a guest star on Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Three or four times a day I would sit by my fax machine and watch the piece of paper slowly revealing her next missive,” Perry wrote in his 2022 memoir. He revealed that he would find himself at a "party sharing a flirtatious exchange with an attractive woman and cut the conversation short, so I could race home and see if a new fax had arrived. Nine times out of 10, one had.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Matthew Perry And Aisha Tyler On The Set Of Friends?</a></span></p><p>Perry added that the Erin Brockovich star's messages were “so smart” and he felt as if “she was placed on this planet to make the world smile”.</p><p>“The way she strung sentences together, the way she saw the world, the way she articulated her unique thoughts, all was so captivating,” he added, revealing their first phone call together lasted for five hours.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perry explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he broke up with Julia Roberts</a> because dating the Oscar winner was "too much for him," and he was sure she would end the relationship. “So instead of facing the inevitable agony of losing her, I broke up with the beautiful and brilliant Julia Roberts.”</p><h2 id=more-of-matthew-perry-39-s-famous-past-relationships>More Of Matthew Perry's Famous Past Relationships</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-one-friends-question-matthew-perry-told-an-interviewer-to-stop-asking-during-their-candid-conversation-1.jpg><p>Cameron Diaz and Julia Roberts were not the only<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> famous women Matthew Perry has been connected to</a>.

"We drove out to swim in creeks, had beers in the local college bar, kissed in a field of long grass. It was a magical summer."</p><p>“He had shot the pilot of Friends, but it had not aired yet. He was nervous, hoping his big break was just around the corner. It was. We stayed friends for a while until we drifted apart, but I was always happy to see him when I did," she added, revealing there was no dramatic break-up between the acting duo.</p><p>Matthew Perry was also linked to Neve Campbell, Lauren Graham and Baywatch actress Yasmine Bleeth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Matthew Perry Dating Anyone At The Time Of His Death?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matthew Perry also revealed in his memoir that he had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a secret make-out session with his Sydney co-star, Valerie Bertinelli</a>, while her then-husband, Eddie Van Halen, was passed out nearby. "Valerie and I had a long, elaborate make-out session. It was happening — maybe she felt the same way I did. I told her I had thought about doing that for a long time, and she had said it right back to me."</p><p>Matthew Perry's longest relationship was with the Mean Girls actress, Lizzy Caplan, although he doesn't mention her by name in his memoir. When the couple separated in 2012, Perry writes about the <a href=#>break-up with great regret</a>. "All my fears reared up like a snake," he penned. "I often think if I'd asked [her to marry me], now we'd have two kids and a house.
