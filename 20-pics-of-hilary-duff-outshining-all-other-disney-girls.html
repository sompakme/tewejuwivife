Yet at the same time, she's also not accomplishing what some of her peers have done. Even those who have come in after her have seen greater success. Meanwhile, she has also succeeded more than others at her same level a few years back. It is likely that she was held back due to a certain situation that kind of got in the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Duff had a child and wanted to be around him initially. It took time to get back to work, but like all women with children, she managed to juggle being a mother and even a wife. This on top of acting, being a driver, cleaner, and much more. Apparently, guys, this whole "mother" thing is hard work. Shocking, we know! Duff managed, and then saw an ability to do more.</p><p>Duff originally became known through the Disney television show, Lizzie McGuire. This television show was a huge hit for Disney, but it was never going to last forever. This led to Duff being used in other projects for the Mickey Mouse organization, as they saw Hilary as someone they could use for years to come in other Disney material. This led to her addition to the movie Agent Cody Banks, and the DCOM Cadet Kelly. They also went to movie theaters for the first time with an original Disney TV show with the Lizzie McGuire movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It did moderately well, but proved the drawing power of Hilary Duff was relatively good. She is now starring in the television show Younger, where she has been since 2015. She has also been a frequent guest host on The Talk. She may be destined for more with the new movie The Haunting of Sharon Tate. Regardless, there is a theory that Duff very well could outshine all other Disney starlets if given an even playing field to do so. When it comes to beauty, Duff is a bombshell. Ultimately, we're going to show off the beauty of Hilary Duff and explain why she may be someone to keep your eye on this year and next year. We hope you enjoy our list of 20 pics that show Hilary Duff will always outshine other Disney girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-bikini-photos-from-the-paparazzi-notallheroeswearcapes><strong>The Bikini Photos From The Paparazzi (#NotAllHeroesWearCapes)</strong></h2><p>One thing often forgotten about Hilary Duff is that she keeps in great shape, as noticed by her body in a bikini. Duff is not a show-off, however, as she often does not take photos of herself in a bikini. While she has done this in the past, she is relatively humble about her body despite&nbsp;the fact that every man in the world would not say no to seeing her like this more often. With social media being huge for her, she likely could get paid to be an Instagram or Twitter model. It does not take a rocket scientist to do it either. Kim Kardashian does it, so we're just saying.</p><p>Duff loves going to the beach, like most of us. However, unlike your Facebook friend Sheryl, she is not going around trying to be spotted by cameras or taking pics of herself. Hilary Duff often uses social media but only really takes pics of her son. This is by design, as she does not want to do it. Yet Duff is a blonde bombshell that any paparazzi is going to snap a picture of if he or she sees her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to this, it is up to the paparazzi to capture photos of her. Paparazzi take pics and they hit the internet. Could it be something Duff knows is happening? She does try to smile when she sees the cameras. So you can&nbsp;be the judge on this one.</p><h2 id=she-knows-how-to-wear-jeans-yes-better-than-you-too><strong>She Knows How To Wear Jeans (Yes, Better Than You Too)</strong></h2><p>Hilary Duff is in great shape. So it comes as no surprise that she likes to wear outfits that show off her body. Most women would give their&nbsp;souls up to have a body like Duff's, and the reason simply is because she is seemingly sculpted from a God or Goddess (we're equal opportunity deity believers). With that said, Hilary Duff clearly figured out who to sell her soul to in order to find a way to fit perfectly in jeans.</p><p>The interesting point here is that it seems that Duff has mastered the art of the jean. In that, she looks perfect in them every time. We believe that her never missing leg day helped this along with proper squats. However, it's not like any of us are physical therapists here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hilary shows us here via yet another paparazzi moment that she cannot go anywhere without being followed. While this seems to be odd for you or us, for Duff and other celebrities, it's a common thing. This is why Duff has to be REALLY confident before wearing anything out in public. It paid off in this outfit. Confidence is key in the acting community. She has it and always did. Yet if you see her, how could someone like Duff not be confident? We'll ask special judge Demi Lovato, and get back to you.</p><h2 id=flawless-twinning-that-lindsey-lohan-would-be-jealous-of><strong>Flawless Twinning That Lindsey Lohan Would Be Jealous Of</strong></h2><p>Over a decade ago, Hilary Duff starred in The Lizzie McGuire Movie. It was a well-liked movie by fans of the show, and it truly stood out as a big deal for Disney. It was not their first venture into theatrical releases, but it was with an original Disney Channel show. They had no idea how well it would work, but it ended up doing far better than people assumed. Out of the $17 million it had in the budget, it made the studio back a little over $55 million. More than double the budget means success in Hollywood. It gave them the confidence to do it again, which they would do with Hannah Montana later on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet Lizzie was first. During this movie, there is a memorable part where Hilary Duff is playing not only Lizzie but a pop star out of Italy, where the movie is taking place. A break up happens with the pop star's singing partner and the singer. Lizzie gets roped into the group due to looking exactly like the singer who left the group. There are nefarious things at work, as they want to embarrass the pop star, so Lizzie has to sing to show that the star lost it, but they did not know Lizzie could sing a bit.</p><p>This leads to the moment above where two Hilary Duffs are present. But they're totally different because one has blonde hair and the other has brunette hair. Plus one has an Italian accent...sort of. It's like Linsey Lohan in Parent Trap with her English accent. No one ever said Duff was good with accents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-survived-the-aaron-carter-dating-period><strong>She Survived The Aaron Carter Dating Period</strong></h2><p>Years ago when Hilary Duff was working with Disney Channel, she was known to be one of the most beautiful young actresses in Hollywood. It made total sense for her to date at that time, especially another famous person. The weird part was that she decided to date a man by the name of Aaron Carter. While Carter had a brother Nick who was part of the Backstreet Boys, he was able to step out of his brother's shadow and become a teen heartthrob at a time when this sort of thing had not happened in a major way. Think of Carter like you think of Justin Bieber in that, they both went down a similar road. The bad part for Carter was that he often mishandled his money. However, his family also did this too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back then, however, he was a teen and Duff was a teen. The major problem was that Carter had a ton of issues even as a kid, which came out later on. He would date Duff off and on again for a while but had also been linked to other young starlets at the same time (one being Lindsay Lohan). Their relationship was sort of weird, as neither seemed to have the time to be in one. However, they tried off and on, but it never truly worked. Despite this, it became a relationship the media loved to follow. She also dodged a bullet, as Carter got into more trouble as time went on. Had she remained with him, who knows how she might have turned out.</p><h2 id=the-lizzie-mcguire-phenomenon-that-sparked-a-job-for-life><strong>The Lizzie McGuire Phenomenon That Sparked A Job For Life</strong></h2><p>Hilary Duff, of course, made her name with Lizzie McGuire and was one of the first true breakout stars Disney had created. Along with Raven Symone, Duff was a key figure in Disney rising up children's programming to overtake Nickelodeon for a while. Despite not ever truly beating out Nick for long, the Disney Channel saw a significant pop in ratings when they aired new episodes for Lizzie. This led to their finale being an entire movie instead of a longer episode. Her show was pretty iconic, and Duff cannot go anywhere without being recognized for the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Disney was already a well-known company, and Disney already had a few shows that had done well. However, this early 2000's period saw the channel go for more live action shows that led to more down the line. While Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and many more would go on to star on Disney shows and become major names...Duff was one of the few Disney wanted to continue to make money with. This is likely why she still works under the Disney banner even today, though on the Freeform Channel. They're still making a lot of money using her, but at one point Duff was considered the "it" girl for the network.</p><p>So much so that Disney wanted to make sure they could use her for multiple other projects. For her part, she did want to take breaks and not remain just a Disney or child star byproduct. She wanted to be her own woman for a while. However, it is not shocking that her Lizzie fame led to Disney making money. The continued use of Duff is due to Disney still being obsessed with using her as much as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-music-career-has-continued><strong>The Music Career Has Continued...</strong></h2><p>While many girls who star in big shows from Disney are able to sing, some go on to have some huge careers in that world. Demi Lovato became a massive hit in the world of music along with Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and many more. Even some guys made the transition pretty easily too. Some like Zendaya kept a singing career alive but went toward the acting world a bit more. Hilary Duff carved out a relatively good career for herself in acting, but her music career was not much of a career when she was with Disney. The Mickey Mouse brand often holds their stars back in their musical journey, and they hardly have the ability to express true feelings in song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Duff sort of had a small music career with Disney, but not much of one to write home about. That is why her return to music in 2014 became such a huge deal for her and for music. She took a break from a lot, but none more than her music career. She attempted to transition into this a bit easier when leaving Disney, but nothing took off as she had hoped. Despite that, she would make it in acting and settled for this as a better option. The small breaks and life she went through made her 2014 return to music that much better. While her album did not go platinum or anything, it did well enough for her to continue.</p><p>Since her music career began, however, she has sold over 15 million albums. Duff has remained in and out of music since. When someone is multi-talented, they are clearly one invest in.</p><h2 id=it-s-in-the-family><strong>It's In The Family</strong></h2><p>Hilary notably has a sister named Haylie who she has often been spotted with. They have both acted and sang together in multiple timeframes. In fact, remember the pop star from The Lizzie McGuire movie? Isabella? Haylie actually sang this part while Hilary sang for Lizzie. Disney knew they needed to keep it close to Hilary's voice without being exactly the same, so Haylie helped. Their mother was actually the driving force that ultimately led to their acting and singing careers. She encouraged her girls to go to singing, acting, and go to ballet classes as they were very useful to the girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To top it off, they were very good at a lot of this. The classes were used to help make them better. Ultimately, this ability to learn about the arts allowed for the Duff girls to get opportunities in the music and acting world. They would move along with their mom to California to pursue careers there in 1993. Hilary ran into getting her big Disney break due in part to this move where she and her sister could go out for roles. None of which would have happened without their mother's encouragement. The ability to continue on in both fields, even after random breaks, is due to the fact that she knows how to navigate the world of both very well.</p><p>That takes being raised well by a great mom, but it also helps to have encouragement from a sister going through a similar path. Then to add in the classes, which also go over a lot of this stuff is clearly useful too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-adult-move-we-expected-yet-never-truly-saw-coming><strong>The Adult Move We Expected, Yet Never Truly Saw Coming</strong></h2><p>Hilary Duff was known as Lizzie to all of us. However, Disney holds their girls back a lot. This happens in vulnerable teen years where a lot is on their mind. The conservative Disney holding them back makes them want to break out once they leave. While some girls gradually grow up and get into more adult material at a slow pace, Disney girls seem to jump head first. We notice them in a PG Disney Show and the next time we see them, they're barely wearing anything or letting curse words fly. There's a lot there that is held back that other girls can explore in a small, less public sort of way.</p><p>These girls are not given the option. While many girls were pretty big in their change, Miley Cyrus being likely the biggest example, Hilary Duff also had a small jump in more adult-centered programming. This happened officially with War, Inc. The movie was one where she relied a ton on her good looks. The character was used in this way and Duff did play it well. Due to the content she was connected to in this movie, we actually were limited with the pictures we could show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The character she represents did give her the adult factor she wanted. However, it seemed like she wanted to do this role just to prove she could do it. She did not star in another film like it afterward.</p><h2 id=the-rivalry-to-end-all-rivalries-sort-of><strong>The Rivalry To End All Rivalries</strong>....<strong>Sort Of</strong></h2><p>We casually glossed over this earlier, but Hilary Duff did in fact date Aaron Carter. The two were an on and off again couple from 2001 to 2003 before he would end up meeting another teen star in Lindsay Lohan. He would date her and then break things off to go back to Duff. At one point, there was an assumption he was dating them at the same time. So it became a pretty complicated and crazy situation. Both girls ended up in a rivalry over it, which was likely the most well-known teen rivalry going in this period. It was stupid to fight over someone like Carter, who did not end up with either girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Duff and Lohan went down totally different paths as well. It seemed Lindsey fit the older crowd more than Duff did. Hilary liked being the family type of actress or singer while Lohan enjoyed the adult or teen roles more. It's no shock that Lohan did do a lot of Disney connected projects, but she never outright worked on a television show for them like Duff did. She mostly did teen movies like Freaky Friday or Mean Girls while Duff did mostly the Lizzie television show and some successful movies, but none that went too far outside the family environment for a while. Such as the Cheaper by the Dozen films, and A Cinderella Story.</p><p>The rivalry lasted a short while, so Duff does have a celebrity rivalry on her record where it does appear she ended up in the better place at the end of it all. In 2009, Duff and Lohan would seem to end their long rivalry over the Carter nonsense. They're now showbiz friends. In that, they say they're friends in public but never talk or hang out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hilary-duff-takes-on-cosmo><strong>Hilary Duff Takes On Cosmo</strong></h2><p>Cosmopolitan is a well-known magazine that often featured notable celebrities. The idea behind bringing in Hilary Duff for a photo shoot and spread in a certain issue was mostly due to her comeback. Known as Cosmo among its readers, the magazine has been in circulation for years and is quite notable among women. However, men have often read it. Times can get rough in a doctor's visit, ladies. When Hilary Duff appeared on the cover of the magazine in 2015, many wondered if Hilary was headed for a major new venture. In theory, she was. She planned to star in the Freedom series Younger, which ultimately began in 2015 and is still going today on the network.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The magazine was able to sort of bring up old material that we could finally get answers to. Such as her past relationship with Aaron Carter, her music career, as well as her marriage and then divorce from former NHL player Mike Comrie. She also sheds light on her son, Luca in the spread. The overall read is pretty good, but when they mentioned that she was back...they did not mean in just a television show or in music. She looked amazing on the cover and in the magazine, with the photos she would do for them. As you can see above, whether you see a final product from the shoot or the set-up for everything they have to do, Duff looks absolutely amazing.</p><h2 id=the-marriage-and-divorce><strong>The Marriage And Divorce</strong></h2><p>Hilary Duff married former NHL player Mike Comrie back in 2010 in Santa Barbara. This marriage would get a lot of attention. While Comrie was not the most notable hockey player, Duff was clearly quite famous. The combination of actor and athlete made many media members want to get photos. OK Magazine happened to be the winner in the end, who did an entire spread on the marriage. Duff looked absolutely stunning as all brides wish to be on their wedding day. While these photos show a happy bride on her big day, the honeymoon was over relatively quick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mike and Hilary would divorce 6 years later, officially ending their marriage in 2016. Though they separated 3 years earlier, it took some time for stuff to finalize. The reasoning was irreconcilable&nbsp;differences, which is a pretty common divorce term. Duff has since been dating off and on since she is still on the market technically speaking. Though she is not looking to randomly get married, she has mentioned that she is open to something new with someone special. Obviously many men around the world are interested in Hilary. However, they should not randomly expect her to just go with it. She has a son, named Luca, who is the #1 guy in her life. She will always do what is best for him. However, it's worth a shot to try and get a date with Hilary Duff, clearly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-disney-icon-all-look-up-to><strong>The Disney Icon All Look Up To</strong></h2><p>It's pretty common by now, but due to the fame that Hilary Duff built up as the "it" girl for Disney in the early 2000s, she became an icon for the network. Disney and Hilary grew attached to the hip, and she has never spoken out negatively about her time there. In fact, it was likely Hilary Duff who forced the network and Disney overall to continue down the path of pushing for women to be the overall lead in most shows. While every show had a male representative, all had a strong female representative. Even in cases like Even Stevens and the Suite Life shows where the main characters are guys, there are MAJOR female roles attached to every single show.</p><p>Meanwhile, in female-driven shows, the lead actor often has a female friend and the male characters are not present in a big way in every show. While they are used, it's not as common for them to be used as frequently as the ladies. Duff did not start this, but she did give them hope that it could continue to work. Thus, more girls followed that route, like Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus and several others. Both of which have claimed that Duff was a hero of theirs and that she was a role model that they aspired to be like. For her part, Duff has attempted to always be that for young women. However, she also has mentioned that all girls have the power to do well, and they don't have to aspire to be like her or anyone else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-can-write-as-well-as-she-looks><strong>She Can Write As Well As She Looks</strong></h2><p>Hilary Duff randomly decided to get into writing one day and had a bit of an interest in the writing genre. This led to Duff becoming quite interested in a story that she felt could be told via a novel, which worked out pretty well. Obviously, publishers wanted to work with someone with the notable name power Hilary Duff provided, so she was given a book deal with ease. This led to her first novel being published in 2010 called Elixir. The book was such a hit with people that it landed on the New York Times bestseller list. Due to the wild success of the book, Duff decided to make a sequel called Devoted in 2011, which was followed by a third and final book to the story called True in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her writing seemed to be a critical success, with Star Magazine marveling at the writing. They handed the first book a 3 out of 4-star rating and even MTV Book Report loved the book and thought it would be a good plan to do a movie adaptation of the Elixir novel. With two spin-offs, it does seem likely such an idea could work out. While her writing was useful in book form, she also wrote a fashion column at one point. It seemed like this beautiful young actress, at the time married, was focused on a career behind a computer rather than in front of the camera. While she would end up back in the spotlight again, there was a time when many wondered if she would be. However, if she kept up with impressive literature...we could not fault her for it.</p><h2 id=her-major-disney-channel-original-movie-debut><strong>Her Major Disney Channel Original Movie Debut</strong></h2><p>On Disney Channel, they have something known as a DCOM. This stands for Disney Channel Original Movie, and it's quite a big deal to star in one. Often they use people that are part of major shows on their network, or will soon be part of one. It's uncommon for the star to not get a big offer for a show or already be in one when things get going, but after the High School Musical success, Zac Efron never starred in any other DCOM. But he did appear in some Disney shows off and on. Before this, being part of a DCOM was a significant situation as most were given a big role if they were at the top of the network. For Hilary Duff and Christy Carlson Romano, the two biggest female stars the network had in 2002, the movie Cadet Kelly was their huge opportunity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike the shows, DCOMs have a certain time limit they have to be filmed in. Shows have a while to get things done, and some even film during the season they are part of. However, a movie is short and sweet. It has to be, as the actors who are part of other shows have to get back to them. This leads to very little downtime for the stars but the movie gives a nice payday. Cadet Kelly was a smash hit for the network and is still voted among the best DCOMs the network ever produced. Duff would not star in another DCOM, but why would she want to? Sometimes, it's okay to be a one-hit wonder.</p><h2 id=those-late-night-with-seth-meyers-outfits><strong>Those Late Night With Seth Meyers Outfits</strong></h2><p>Hilary Duff has appeared on several talk shows over the years, but as she got older...those shows were very few and far between. This was mainly due to the time she took for herself. She would do bit parts here and there until she decided to join up with the new Freeform show Younger. This overall move has been good for her, as the show has been a hit. This has gotten her out of the normal daytime talk show or morning show routine she would normally be associated with. Now, late night shows wanted to book her more often. One of the major ones was Late Night with Seth Meyers, an NBC product.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meyers has been great in the part, and Late Night is one of the long-standing talk shows on television. It was originally started with David Letterman decades ago, as a show to have after The Tonight Show, following Johnny Carson. When Dave moved, it ended up with Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Fallon, now Seth Meyers. All with Saturday Night Live ties.&nbsp; That said, the show has had some pretty big success. With the rise of the internet, all the late night shows get attention.</p><p>With Hilary Duff being present on this show, she'll be seen a lot as a result. It is never bigger than now to be on the late night shows, so Duff has to make an impression. These were her outfits, and we can pretty much assure you that they made an impression on not only the host himself but everyone watching at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=working-out-is-important><strong>Working Out Is Important...</strong></h2><p>Hilary Duff has made it important to be healthy at this point in her life. She is a mother and now at the big 3-0. Staying healthy for not only herself, but her child as well is clearly a must. Duff has tried to accomplish this by working out as often as she can. Like many women, she attends regular classes on certain activities. However, Duff is known for working out in the infamous yoga pants. This can make any woman stand out, but it seems Duff should teach classes on the idea of wearing them. Photos of her in them are abundant on the internet, as she is a favorite among paparazzi already. However, she's an even bigger favorite for them when she goes to the gym.</p><p>Due to being known for working out and being in great shape, she was part of Shape Magazine where she gave them a rundown of what she does to stay looking great. She told Shape that filming in New York changed up her work out situation.&nbsp;A new city and a new area to go to work out can be tough to find. So what does Duff do to stay in shape? She told them:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Filming in New York now, my workouts have changed, but I found a really great trainer at Soho Strength Lab. When I go there, I do lots of squats, kettlebells, deadlifts, and medicine ball slams. And then I hit the stair master or treadmill for cardio. I've also been using the rower lately; I literally almost puked the other day on it! (Here, a full-body rowing workout to burn a crap ton of calories.) Next, I really want to try some new classes like AKT and Orangetheory—I use the MindBody app which gives you the schedules of all your favorite classes."</p><h2 id=bold-fashion-choices-somehow-work-for-her><strong>Bold Fashion Choices Somehow Work For Her</strong></h2><p>When you look as good as Hilary Duff, it's pretty simple to throw pretty much anything on and have it work for you. Whether it is an interesting hair color that no one thought she would ever do or wearing an outfit that seems to be odd, she somehow continues to set trends rather than look weird. The most difficult thing to look back on for Duff, we assume, is the crazy fashion choices she made that are no longer sensible to go with today. However, at the time she was ahead of the curve. While with Disney, her look was seemingly a trend everyone followed. This may not have been the goal for her, as she just wanted to stand out as her own woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To be different in the world of Hollywood is essential. For Duff, it was just a matter of going with something she thought looked good. Her fashion choices led her to become a trendsetter, and her voice in this world led to being used as a fashion analyst and columnist for a few places.</p><p>She opened up her own clothing line back in 2004 called "Stuff by Hilary Duff" and though the business has not become a massive hit, it has done relatively well. She also has a children's clothing line today. It seems that she is doing well in this field. Others spend hours and hours, even days and weeks contemplating what they want to wear. It seems Duff spends 5 minutes finding an outfit in her closet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-child-does-seem-to-be-her-entire-world><strong>Her Child Does Seem To Be Her Entire World</strong></h2><p>Hilary Duff's son Luca is getting older these days, but he has been in the media spotlight since he was no less than a week old. This happens a lot with celebrities. Photos are going to come out about a pregnant celebrity and clearly, those celebs are going to be seen with a new child eventually. This means it makes total sense that Luca would be in the spotlight often. When Duff got married in 2010, having children was a priority of her's. She announced her pregnancy a year later and by March 2012, her son was born. Barely in 2018, and he's around 5 years old already.</p><p>She is spotted with him wherever she goes it seems. However, this is a bit loaded. When she divorced her husband, she requested sole custody of their son. While it is not uncommon for mothers to want custody of their child, and often get it, the idea of him being in just one home was odd. One would assume his father would want to be around.</p><p>It is no secret, as TMZ is always on the case, that there have been some issues with her ex-husband. This is likely why she easily won sole custody and why she eventually put her marriage to an end. Talk about truly blowing a good thing, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sisterhood-of-the-traveling-jeans><strong>Sisterhood Of The Traveling Jeans</strong></h2><p>Here's a small bit of trivia. Remember the&nbsp; Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movies? The ones with that chick from Gossip Girl who is married to Deadpool and that girl from Gilmore Girls? No, the daughter. Yeah, that one. The movies were a relatively big success for the women involved, and it allowed them to truly stand out in an era where these types of movies did not often work out. Hilary Duff was almost cast in the movie as weird as it seems today. The role she would have played would have been that of Tibby. This role was very different for her, but it clearly would have worked with how the movie was designed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The director Ken Kwapis did like Duff but decided to go with Amber Tamblyn for the role instead. Obviously Amber did do well in the role, and it would be tough to see Tamblyn removed from the role of Tibby today. However, with a rumored Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 3, it would not shock us if things came full circle and Hilary Duff was asked to star in the movie. It would be the right thing to do, right? Plus, it seems like Hilary Duff can do no wrong when it comes to pants, or...well...jeans. Truly it would make a lot of sense to add her to the franchise, however, it's funny to assume she could have been in it from the start.</p><h2 id=the-day-she-broke-the-entire-internet><strong>The Day She Broke The Entire Internet</strong></h2><p>There is never a time where you know you still have it more than when the entire internet shuts down for a minute to take a look at something you have done. Hilary Duff had been on television and in music, already back in the public eye in a broader scale for a few years. However, some simple paparazzi pictures made their way to the internet and people absolutely lost their minds. As you can see above, Hilary is a mere pink dress. There is nothing overly special about the dress, of course. The special part is simply her IN said dress. Why is this so significant? Obviously, if you see the way she looks in&nbsp;the dress, it does not take a rocket scientist to explain why many people loved it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the real catch to it was that this made waves virally. People who had not seen Hilary Duff in years basically caught up with her through these few photos taken of her. She is simply on the sidewalk, shooting for her television show. However, the dress she wore and the way she looked in it caught everyone's attention. Facebook and Twitter went nuts over it, which made televised media take notice and spread it out even more. She told Kelly & Ryan Live regarding breaking the internet over the photos:</p><p>"I was lucky for a killer dress and some great spanks underneath there. But I'll take it. I was shooting the show, so I did not see it as everything is going on. When my friends started sending me stuff, I was like, that has to be photoshop. Is that what's happening back there?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources: [</strong>Pinterest, MTV Book Report, HawtCelebs, MTV, Gurl.com, Kelly & Ryan Live, Shape Magazine, Star Magazine, OK Magazine, Freeform Network, Disney, Good Morning America, MTV, IMDB, Cosmopolitan Magazine<strong>]</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGK9qq%2FSZqafZZieuaK%2B2Gabrp6WYry2wNKhoKehnpx6orjLZqatoJWneqW10qecsmWXnr%2Btv44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./danny-trejo-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Trejo Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
