Born in 1922 in New Haven, Connecticut, Lear’s early life was marked by significant events that would later shape his work and advocacy. His father’s imprisonment for selling fake bonds and his encounter with an anti-Semitic radio priest left a lasting impact on Lear’s worldview.</p><p>After serving in the US Army Air Forces during World War II, Lear ventured into the field of public relations. However, his passion for storytelling led him to pursue a career in television writing. In the 1950s, Lear started his writing career by collaborating with his cousin Ed Simmons, where they found success and earned a substantial income from comedy writing.</p><p>With his early experiences serving as a source of inspiration, Lear’s career in entertainment was just beginning.
