Kramer admitted to having some “flings and flirts” when they briefly separated when Caussin went to rehab. The former One Tree Hill actress wrote: “I never truly thought I did anything wrong. Correction. I knew it was wrong; I just didn’t want to be the bad guy. I justified my actions in my mind just as I suppose Mike had done all along too.”</p><h2 id=gleb-savchenko-39-s-wife-accused-him-of-cheating-on-her>Gleb Savchenko's Wife Accused Him Of Cheating On Her</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gleb-Sevchenko-Elena-Samodanova-Split.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of Jana Kramer's marital woes, Gleb Savchenko was married to Elena Samodanova. Savchenko and Samodanova - who have two daughters together - announced their split in November 2020. Her rep claimed in December 2020: “It’s no secret that Gleb has had affairs with former dance partners — and who knows who else."</p><p>Kramer and Caussin split in 2016 after he allegedly cheated with multiple women and sought treatment for sex addiction. But the pair - who share daughter Jolie, six, and son Jace, three - reconciled in 2017 and renewed their vows in Hawaii. However, they split for good last year, when Jana discovered a woman texted him a topless photo in October 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2><img alt="Jana Kramer Arm Around Ian Schinelli Swimwear Smiling" height=628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jana-Kramer-Arm-Around-Ian-Schinelli-Swimwear-Smiling.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto width=1200></h2><p>Jana went on to date former Navy Seal Ian Schinelli, 36, for six months. They <a href=#>broke up in April</a>. The fitness trainer claimed that Jana slept with two men during her 2016 split from husband Mike Caussin. “Jana has admitted to me that she slept with two guys while Mike was in rehab. She slept with Gleb,” Ian told Us Weekly. “She justified it saying, ‘We were legally separated.' She even tried to meet up with Gleb while we were dating."</p><p>"He was doing a show in Nashville and she asked me if it was OK if she met up with him. I said, ‘As long as there was nothing there anymore,’ and she said, ‘No.’ She never went and said it was out of respect for me.”</p><p>Schinelli previously claimed to Us Weekly that Kramer had an "anxious attachment" to the men in her life. He theorized that it may have been spawned due to her relationship breakdown with Caussin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2><img alt="Jana Kramer and Gleb Savchenko on Dancing With The Stars" height=628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/OjlhAKqSM_JY9Ryd8mGzyFVlbiEWbmaqBMN1Arf4iAA.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto width=1200></h2><p>Kramer has strenuously denied she had an affair with Savchenko claiming that Schinelli was lying and "twisting the story" in a statement to Us Weekly. "The reason I haven’t said anything further on this breakup was because Ian lied about cheating on his ex-wife and I was trying to protect her. She has become a friend of mine and I was trying to protect her privacy, but she has now given me permission to speak on her behalf."</p><p>Kramer went on to add: "Ian is angry because all of his lies have been figured out and is now twisting the story. I have since found out from many women I was not the only one during our relationship, but I’m happily moving on with my life and I hope for him to do the same."</p><p>Schinelli responded: "I apologized to my ex-wife and owned my mistakes. … Jana is hurt and is using it against me."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Jana Kramer's Dating History And Her Short Fling With Kristin Cavallari's Ex</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gleb-savchenko-denied-reports-he-had-an-affair-with-jana-kramer>Gleb Savchenko Denied Reports He Had An Affair With Jana Kramer</h2><p>Meanwhile Gleb Savchenko denied that he had an affair with his celebrity dance partner Jana Kramer while filming Dancing With The Stars.

Absolutely not. Absolutely not," he said. "Whatever she might have said it to her boyfriend, maybe she tried to make him jealous, you know. You can ask her the same question, she'll probably answer the same thing."</p><p>Kramer has been married three times. In 2004, she was married to Michael Gambino. He was later charged with domestic violence and attempted to kill her. Kramer became engaged to actor Johnathon Schaech, who she had met on the set of Prom Night. They married on July 4, 2010, in Michigan, but separated a month later. She then went on to marry Mike Caussin.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Really Went Down Between Jana Kramer And Her Former Husband, Michael Gambino?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWSbnaSssqa6jKOYp5ldoL%2BiucSrZKCklZd6tK3VnJ%2BeppukfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rza.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                                                                      RZA                       ">&larr;
