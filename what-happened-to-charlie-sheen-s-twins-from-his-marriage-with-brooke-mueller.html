It all started to go downhill when he was fired from <strong><a href=#>Two and a Half Men</a></strong> after problematic behavior on set. Meanwhile, things in his personal life didn’t seem to go well either. The actor has gotten married on three different occasions and has a total of five children. Some recent paparazzi pictures tell us exactly what the actor’s relationship with the twins he had with Brooke Mueller is like.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Charlie Sheen Still Hasn't Lived Down That Time He Shared His Phone Number With All Of Twitter</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-sheen-and-brooke-mueller-met-through-a-common-friend>Charlie Sheen and Brooke Mueller Met Through a Common Friend</h2><p>Charlie Sheen landed his first professional role when he was only nine years old, by appearing in his father's 1974 film The Execution of Private Slovik. After starring in a handful of TV movies, Sheen finally landed the breakthrough role of his career in Oliver Stone’s autobiographical war drama Platoon in 1986. Since then, this actor has appeared in 87 films and TV shows over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/brooke-mueller-and-charlie-sheen-on-a-red-carpet.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Brooke Mueller is an actress who’s also known for working as a special correspondent on Extra. She is best known for playing Janet in the 1999 direct-to-video film Witchouse. Additionally, she’s known for playing Cassandra in the 2008 comedy film Strictly Sexual and for co-starring in the reality TV show The World According to Paris alongside her Paris Hilton.

The pair through a mutual friend, Jawbreaker actress Rebecca Gayheart. At the time, Sheen had just ended his relationship with Denise Richards, and Mueller was working towards making a name for herself in the industry. After meeting, the two instantly connected and started dating. And approximately one year later, Sheen proposed to Mueller with a million-dollar diamond ring.</p><h2 id=charlie-sheen-and-brooke-mueller-rsquo-s-relationship-was-very-controversial-and-their-divorce-was-even-worse>Charlie Sheen and Brooke Mueller’s Relationship Was Very Controversial, and Their Divorce Was Even Worse</h2><p>Charlie Sheen and Brooke Mueller got married in 2008 after a one-year engagement. The couple tied the knot in a small, 60-person wedding ceremony held in Beverly Hills. And a year later, they welcomed a pair of twins, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Max and Bob Sheen</a>, into the world. But, as good as things started for the couple, their relationship soon took a turn for the worst.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar42273002.jpg><p>At one point in their relationship. Sheen was arrested on charges of domestic abuse. However, the actor was released from jail the same day after posting an $8,500 bond. Despite this, he later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to 30 days in a drug rehab center, 30 days of probation, and 36 hours of anger management.</p><p>In 2010, Sheen filed for divorce. During Charlie Sheen and Brooke Mueller's divorce proceedings, Mueller sought primary custody of their sons, Bob and Max. But after she checked into rehab in December 2010, Sheen's representatives tried to use that to get Sheen primary custody of the kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Charlie Sheen's 'Two And A Half Men' Co-Star Heather Locklear Showed Support During His Toughest Time, Unlike Jenny McCarthy</a></span></p><p>However, in 2011, police removed Max and Bob from Sheen's home after the actor lost temporary custody of the children. According to People, social services took the children because <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mueller had obtained a restraining order against Sheen</a>. Ultimately, Sheen and Mueller's divorce was finalized in May 2011. The divorce settlement ordered the actor to pay Mueller $750,000 per their prenuptial agreement, plus $55,000 per month in child support for their two sons.</p><h2 id=does-charlie-sheen-have-a-good-relationship-with-his-twins-from-his-marriage-with-brooke-mueller>Does Charlie Sheen Have a Good Relationship with His Twins From His Marriage with Brooke Mueller?</h2><p>Despite their intense divorce, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Mueller and Sheen still get along</a> and have managed to maintain somewhat of a friendship over the years. However, given that both actors have dealt with their fair share of drug abuse and run-ins with the police, neither of them has full custody of their sons, Max and Bob Sheen. Instead, it seems that it’s Mueller’s mother who mainly cares for the children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In August 2018 that he could no longer afford his child support payments after being “blacklisted” from working in Hollywood following his problematic behavior in the Two and a Half Men set. But in 2022, the actor reached an undisclosed financial agreement with his ex-wife. Despite this, Sheen has made the effort to be part of his sons’ lives.</p><p>Earlier this year, the actor was spotted spending an afternoon in Malibu with his sons, Bob and Max.
