I don't know if I agree, because I have, in the past, had people imitate me with the hope that I go home and cry myself to sleep. I did, and salute those who torment me.&nbsp;With that in mind, being parodied (a great offshoot of imitation) in the world of celebrities is generally an open mockery or a great honor. Some people are tasteful with their prodding. <a href=#>Stephen Colbert</a> and <a href=#>Jon Stewart</a> are such examples, as they generally clown around with, and poke fun at their guests, meaning well, but genuinely aiming to entertain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>South Park&nbsp;is a different story, and while <a href=#>Matt Stone</a> and <a href=#>Trey Parker</a> probably don't want anyone to go crawl in a cave and die in response to their ridicule, their masterpiece show is the most ruthless on television when it comes to mocking and parody. <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>, <a href=#>Kanye West</a>, <a href=#>Barbra Streisand</a>, <a href=#>Tom Brady</a>&nbsp;and most recently Caitlyn Jenner, all make up a short list of celebrities who have been thoroughly and in some cases, cruelly torn apart by the show.</p><p>When it comes to parody however, the adult film business brings in a whole new angle. Given their "unique" subject matter, basing a skin-flick on a celebrity offers a chance to poke fun not only at their personalities, but also their sex lives. There are tons of these parodies out there and here is our list of the celebrities who have been the subject of the funniest adult film parodies. There are plenty more, so if we missed yours let us know in the comments section.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-elvis-presley---elvis-xxx-a-p-parody><strong>10. Elvis Presley - Elvis XXX: A P*** Parody</strong></h2><p><a href=#>The King</a> is one of those guys who can't escape the limelight even though he has been dead for decades. He was one of the most entertaining people of his time, and continues to have a legion of die-hard fans, some of whom think he's still alive.</p><p>The flick was made back in 2011 and featured industry veteran Dale DaBone (Jennifer Capriati's former boyfriend, for you sports fans) as Elvis and also had Lexi Belle, Asa Akira and James Deen as James Dean.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-paris-hilton---a-couple-of-films><strong>9. Paris Hilton - A Couple of Films</strong></h2><p>This is kind of a messed up case, because not only is the famous heir,&nbsp;<a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>, one of the United States' most hated celebrities, been the subject of an adult film parody, she has also starred in a couple of home videos that have become really famous. The notorious spoiled brat has also been the "star" of a few parody flicks, including Hairless Hilton: Get Spunk'd and Hustler's Untrue Stories: Paris.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-caitlyn-jenner---kaitlyn-gender-based-on-a-not-so-true-story><strong>8. Caitlyn Jenner - Kaitlyn Gender: Based on a Not So True Story</strong></h2><p>This pretty much had to happen, and leave it to the adult film business to come up with a name like "Kaitlyn Gender" for <a href=#>Caitlyn Jenner</a>, to poke fun at America's favorite transgender senior (almost senior). I wish I had taken bets on what would come first, this or a real sex tape, as that would have been pretty interesting.</p><p>In terms of the idea itself though, it is pure gold. The film itself stars Jonelle Brookes, who is, wait for it, also a transgender woman. The creators and director went to great lengths to make a film that was sensitive to trans issues but also provided a healthy amount of comic relief.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-miley-cyrus---hustler-s-untrue-hollywood-stories-miley-cyrus-18th-birthday><strong>7. Miley Cyrus - Hustler's Untrue Hollywood Stories: Miley Cyrus' 18th Birthday</strong></h2><p>I've already mentioned the publication once and it will be mentioned at least once more, that is of course, Hustler. <a href=#>Larry Flynt</a> and his people continue to be a force in the industry. <a href=#>Miley Cyrus'</a> birthday was the inspiration for this video that was created back in 2010. The funniest part of this entire situation is that they had clearly been planning it for a while because the video itself came out just a week after she actually turned 18. Details of her actual 18th birthday party are also available, and it was an adult affair, but not that adult.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-lindsay-lohan---hustler-s-untrue-hollywood-stories-lindsay-lohan><strong>6. Lindsay Lohan - Hustler's Untrue Hollywood Stories: Lindsay Lohan</strong></h2><p>I had to do a bit of preliminary research to see if this is truly a parody or if some Hustler camera man just happened to run into the real <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> one day. I doubted it obviously, but given the amount of partying and drugs and other various rumors, I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to check, just in case. I'm kidding, stupid joke, but moving on.</p><p>Miss Lohan's adult film parody was made back in 2009, and featured Scarlett Fay as Lindsay and Eden Adams as her friend Paris.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-katy-perry---katy-pervy-the-xxx-parody><strong>5. Katy Perry - Katy Pervy: The XXX Parody</strong></h2><p>While she is the fantasy of men of all ages worldwide, a real sex tape is probably not going to happen anytime soon for <a href=#>Katy Perry</a>. Furthermore, if it had happened while she was married, it would have involved an irritating former heroin enthusiast that would have figured out a way to ruin everything. But I digress, and given her quirky persona and overall beauty, she is an interesting choice for a subject. The film itself was produced back in 2012 and starred industry legend/veteran Kimberly Kane as the titular character. She and co-star Anthony Rosano were nominated for the Most Outrageous Scene award at the ANV award show that year. You'll have to check it out for yourself, I can't describe it here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-jessica-simpson---hustler-s-untrue-hollywood-stories-jessica-simpson><strong>4. Jessica Simpson - Hustler's Untrue Hollywood Stories: Jessica Simpson</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a> was one of the biggest stars in the world about a decade ago, but slipped into relative anonymity for a while. However, there were a few years in which now ex-husband <a href=#>Nick Lachey</a> was the envy of every young male, as he was married to one of the hottest (and dopiest) women on the planet. He has since floated off into the abyss of famous has-beens.</p><p>It was back in 2009 however, shortly after her breakup with NFL quarterback <a href=#>Tony Romo</a> that Simpson was given the parody treatment. Of the notable names on the cast, Jessica Lynn played Simpson herself and Kiera King played her sister <a href=#>Ashlee</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-lady-gaga---this-ain-t-lady-gaga><strong>3. Lady Gaga - This Ain't Lady Gaga</strong></h2><p>Another entry from the wonderful people over at Hustler, This Ain't Lady Gaga is a 2011 edition of the This Ain't series, that Hustler has been producing for ages, that offers parodies of television shows and movies. <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> is one of those enigmatic celebrities who absolutely owns her own style, but has had to endure some bizarre and offensive rumors due to her public image. One of the most ridiculous was the brief discussion many years back over whether she had both male and female genitalia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, given that she was possibly the biggest name in music in 2011, Hustler jumped on the idea of her parody, with a flick that was nominated for six AVN Awards, including best actress for Helly Mae Hellfire (Gaga), Best Makeup, Best Original Song and Best Screenplay-Parody.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-ronda-rousey---ronda-arouseme-grounded-and-pounded><strong>2. Ronda Rousey - Ronda ArouseMe: Grounded and Pounded</strong></h2><p>Another recent entry onto this list (not quite as recent as Caitlyn Jenner) is <a href=#>Ronda Rousey</a>. She is the UFC's Bantamweight Women's Champion and has been for years. She's known for beating opponents in under a minute in the octagon and speaking her mind with quotable honesty when the scrap is over. Her next victory is set for mid-November against Holly Holm. For those who are not familiar, Rousey is also hot, really hot.</p><p>Because of her dominance in the sport of MMA, budding film career, and great looks, 'Burning Angel' decided to parody her in Grounded and Pounded. It has not come out yet, but it has been confirmed that Ronda will be taking on certain competitors such as Miesha Taint. Leave it up to this business to come up with awesome names, they never fail to impress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-sarah-palin---who-s-nailin-paylin><strong>1. Sarah Palin - Who's Nailin' Paylin</strong></h2><p>The king (queen?) of all adult film parodies is definitely that of 2008 Vice Presidential candidate <a href=#>Sarah Palin</a>. Pegged as a complete dingbat by her critics, the former Governor of Alaska had some memorable quotes and misquotes that made her a champion to some and a pariah to others. Whether you loved or hated her however, Palin was pretty attractive for a woman pushing 50 at the time. Back in late 2008, Hustler Video released the film and it starred Lisa Ann, a veteran of over 500 films who has since retired.</p><p>She went on to star as Sierra Paylin in five sequels of this film. It also involved characters based on <a href=#>Bill Clinton</a> and <a href=#>Condoleeza Rice</a>. Later versions included <a href=#>Barack Obama</a> and other political figures. While it is unlikely that Sarah Palin will ever make a real adult movie, the jury is still out on her daughter <a href=#>Bristol</a>, who just a few months ago announced she was pregnant with her second kid, with another father to whom she isn't married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>imdb.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>deathandtaxesmag.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>uproxx.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHq4tM5mn5qulWKupcHLrWSfoZyierGt0aibop2jZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-peek-inside-kevin-hart-s-multi-million-dollar-watch-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Peek Inside Kevin Hart's Multi-Million-Dollar Watch Collection">&larr;
