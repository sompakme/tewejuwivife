It was truly incredible, but when Pratt gave details about his transformation, some things just didn't add up.</p><p>Let's hear what Pratt said about changing his body for Marvel, and whether he may be off on his calculations.</p><h2 id=chris-pratt-made-an-incredible-transformation-for-his-guardians-of-the-galaxy-role>Chris Pratt Made An Incredible Transformation For His Guardians Of The Galaxy Role</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar29803042.jpg><p>Chris Pratt's portrayal of Star-Lord in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has left an indelible mark on both the franchise and the actor's career. Debuting in "Guardians of the Galaxy" in 2014, Pratt's physical transformation and charismatic performance catapulted the character to stardom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Chris Pratt's journey into the MCU was his dramatic physical transformation to embody the character of Star-Lord. Pratt, known for his role on the TV series Parks and Recreation, underwent a rigorous fitness regimen and diet overhaul to transform his physique. This transformation was instrumental in preparing him for the physically demanding role.</p><p>Pratt was initially too heavy, and according to the actor, "They held up the selfie from Zero Dark Thirty and said, ‘You’re too fat for Star-Lord. How long will it take you to look like this?’ They gave me five-and-a-half months. I did what I had to do."</p><p>Now, it's been said that Pratt drastically shifted his diet and fitness regiment, which makes sense. However, a claim was made that he was drinking a gallon of water for every pound that he made. Needless to say, people have been digging into the truth of that claim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aaron-taylor-johnson-transformed-his-body-for-his-best-movies-here-s-the-truth-about-his-diet-and-workout-routine.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Aaron Taylor-Johnson Transformed His Body For His Best Movies, Here’s The Truth About His Diet And Workout Routine</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>How did action star Aaron Taylor-Johnson eat and exercise when he was getting ready for some of his most exciting and popular movies?</span><h2 id=the-details-of-his-transformation-didn-39-t-add-up-as-his-water-intake-was-physically-impossible>The Details Of His Transformation Didn't Add Up, As His Water Intake Was Physically Impossible</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar29808220.jpg><p>"I was peeing all day long, every day,’ Pratt said. ‘That part was a nightmare," Pratt said.</p><p>This is true, but could he have been drinking over 200 gallons of water each day? In short, no.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, "The Vanity Fair article was later changed to say Pratt was advised to drink “one ounce” of water per pound of body weight. Vanity Fair did not respond to requests for comment."</p><p>The site did the math, and given Pratt's weight, he still would have been consuming 15 gallons of water each day!</p><p>The site quoted toxicologist, Ryan Marino, who said, "That’s physically impossible for someone to have and survive/ That would be dangerous for any person, if not deadly,\."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Look, this detail takes absolutely nothing away from what Pratt was able to achieve. The difference between his character, Andy, from Parks and Recreation and Star-Lord was astonishing, regardless of the amount of water that he was forced to drink each day.</p><p>For Pratt, this was a much healthier way of losing was, especially compared to what he had done previously.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jennifer-connelly-s-fiery-romance-with-tom-cruise-in-top-gun-maverick-is-just-one-of-her-best-on-screen-relationships.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jennifer Connelly Lost So Much Weight For A Movie Role But What Has She Said About Her Body Transformation Over The Age Of 50</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jennifer Connelly has transformed her body for movie roles, but she's now more comfortable in her skin than ever.</span><h2 id=it-was-still-healthier-than-his-transformation-for-moneyball-and-zero-dark-thirty>It Was Still Healthier Than His Transformation For Moneyball And Zero Dark Thirty</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/untitled-design-20-1.png><p>As Pratt told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, "I was like, ‘I’m going to cut weight, put on plastics, run and I’m not going to eat.' That’s what I did, but I didn’t realize how that affects your body long-term, so that the minute you stop doing that you balloon your weight back up."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This, according to the site, is the way that Pratt would cut weight when he wrestled in his younger years.</p><p>For his role in Zero Dark Thirty, Pratt also took an unhealthy approach to fitness.</p><p>"I was doing 500 push-ups a day, working out at the gym, running five miles a day, but with no food, and I tore my body apart. I felt terrible afterwards, had to get shoulder surgery, and I wore myself down doing that because I didn’t have the proper coaching," he said.</p><p>Fortunately, once Pratt was up for the role of Star-Lord, he did things the right way, trusting professionals to guide him on his transformation road.</p><p>"I actually lost weight by eating more food, but eating the right food, eating healthy foods and so when I was done with the movie my body hadn’t been in starvation mode. It wasn’t like I was triggered to just gorge myself and get really fat again," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/jJojscVyTeqmKZEirmrKuArHUPy_HGvcE1SNeHd-YVw.jpeg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Johnny Depp's Wild Transformation For Pirates Of The Caribbean Completely Ruin His Teeth?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Johnny Depp underwent extensive dental work for his Pirates of the Caribbean transformation.</span><p>Getting the right people in place was paramount for Chris Pratt, who got in superhero shape for one of the best superheroes movies of its era.
