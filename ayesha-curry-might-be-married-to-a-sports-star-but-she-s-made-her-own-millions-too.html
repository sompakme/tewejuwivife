Most believe that this is because Stephen Curry is a championship basketball player who has numerous sponsorship deals, including a potential $1 billion deal with Under Armour in the works. And while Steph may be the breadwinner of the family that does not mean that Ayesha Curry is sitting on her laurels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead, she has worked hard for nearly a decade and around having children, daughters, <a href=#>Riley Elizabeth</a>, Ryan Carson, and son, Canon W. Jack, to create a lifestyle brand. And in doing so, Ayesha has become a successful entrepreneur and celebrity in her own right in addition to being Steph's wife.</p><p>Ayesha Curry may be married to a sports star, but she's made her own millions too.</p><h2 id=ayesha-curry-39-s-net-worth-may-not-be-like-steph-curry-39-s-but-it-is-impressive>Ayesha Curry's Net Worth May Not Be Like Steph Curry's But It Is Impressive</h2><p>With almost a decade and a half in the NBA, four championship titles to his name, a plethora of sponsorships, ownership in several companies, and more, it does not come as any surprise that Steph is worth over $160 million.</p><p>With him making that kind of money, there is no reason for Ayesha to work or have a job. But because her job helps to fulfill her, it is necessary that she carve out her own identity outside of being the wife of one of the most skilled players to ever be in the NBA. And in following her passion, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an impressive payday has followed</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/c588b1234f7ad43b1ff8500a4bac8b2f.png><p>Since starting her lifestyle brand in 2014, Ayesha has amassed a net worth of $10 million. In order to get to the point of being this successful, however, there were some growing pains along the way. Most of this came in the form of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ayesha getting out of her own way</a> and not letting fear or fear of succeeding stop her from chasing her goals.</p><p>"Not putting a ceiling on myself has really helped — and setting goals, but not dwelling on them if they don’t happen," Ayesha explained. "For me, it hasn’t been about working for those goals. It’s just been about working. It’s about putting forth my best effort every single day..."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Steph Curry's Dad Reportedly Dating The Ex-Wife Of Steph's Mom's New Man</a></span></p><p>She went on to say, "I’ve also learned how to shake off the negatives that happen. The bad things have taught me to be resilient, so I can press forward and get better."</p><p>By following this mantra, Ayesha has not been afraid to try new ventures as part of her lifestyle brand. A move that has allowed her to build what was once a small YouTube channel passion into an entrepreneurial success.</p><h2 id=how-ayesha-curry-made-amassed-her-fortune>How Ayesha Curry Made Amassed Her Fortune</h2><p>Ayesha began to amass her fortune when her YouTube channel, Little Lights of Mine found an audience. Once this happened, Ayesha set her sights bigger. And she has not looked back ever since.</p><p>After launching Little Lights of Mine in 2014, the Food Network came calling. They did not want a <a href=#>cooking competition show</a> but a show that was cooking-based, starring Ayesha. Suddenly, Ayesha was thrust from being a social media and YouTube star to that of the host of her own cooking show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ayesha's Home Kitchen was launched in 2016 and remained on the Food Network until 2018<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screen-shot-2020-09-21-at-3-55-40-pm-1600718151.png><p>Next up for Ayesha was the desire to share her love of "global travel and international cooking" with the masses. Did the daunting task of opening a restaurant stop Ayesha from chasing her dream? Absolutely not.</p><p>Instead, she enlisted Chef Michael Mina to help her accomplish this task. As such, International Smoke was created. And because the restaurant was such a success, a second location was opened three years later.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Steph Curry's Parents' Love Lives Got Extremely Strange After Their Divorce</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was not the end of Ayesha's entrepreneurial spirit, however. Writing two cookbooks, launching a magazine and a production company, and hosting television shows were just on the horizon, not to mention becoming a Cover Girl, and dabbling in her old career of that of an actor.</p><p>It was all of these endeavors together that helped to contribute to the fortune that Ayesha created outside of her husband, Steph.</p><h2 id=is-acting-next-for-ayesha-curry>Is Acting Next For Ayesha Curry?</h2><p>After Ayesha graduated from high school, she left North Carolina and came out to Southern California to chase her dreams of acting. And while it can be hard for some to break into the industry, Ayesha landed roles right away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screen-shot-2022-02-12-at-8.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008 and 2009, Ayesha was cast in both television series and tv movies fairly consistently. She even made an appearance on Hannah Montana. Despite the success she was having though, Ayesha decided to walk away from acting for a time. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But it looks like the acting bug may have bitten Ayesha again</a>. And if it does, there is just that much more money she can add to her net worth.</p><p>Since 2017, Ayesha has been dabbling with parts on the small screen. However, 2022 brought Ayesha a script that she could not refuse, called Irish Wish. The film stars Lindsay Lohan, <a href=#>who is making her Hollywood comeback</a>, and the buzz is that Ayesha plays Lindsay's character's best friend.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Steph Curry's Fans Disappointed After His Mom Is Revealed To Have A Boyfriend</a></span></p><p>Could this be just another venture for Ayesha to add to her resume or is she truly looking at getting back into the entertainment industry in a way that is not food and cooking related? Only time will tell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But if the same frame of mind is used that has been used to launch her lifestyle empire, Ayesha will only succeed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmmLKdo52ubq%2FUq6myZZSkeqe70WaYZqSZq7avs4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./celebrities-that-live-in-florida-sunshine-state-stars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrities That Live in Florida  Sunshine State Stars">&larr;
