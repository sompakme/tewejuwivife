Chances are, you may have overlooked them, or perhaps you haven't even heard of them. For example, if you can speak English, you’re automatically employable in China and have the potential to earn more than a highly-educated Chinese citizen. Then again, going all the way to China to get a job might seem like a big effort. Would you rather stay home and sleep all day? Well, guess what, you can get paid to do that too. Many companies are looking for sleep testers and sleep study participants. And, yes, they’ll actually pay you to sleep on the job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You might be lazy, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re not smart. Looking for something a bit more challenging? Computer programming has been dubbed one of the highest paying, low-effort jobs for lazy people. If sitting on the couch and playing video games is more your forte, consider a career as a video game tester. The pay might not be great, but the job is pretty much as cool as it sounds. If you don’t mind getting some exercise, dog walkers can rake in some serious dough.</p><p>Ranging from no-brainers to the bizarre, what follows is a list of jobs that pay well and require minimal effort. Read on to see which ones fall within our top 10.</p><h2 id=10-professional-foreigner><strong>10. Professional Foreigner</strong></h2><p>Via www.nolimitsecommerce.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you can look smart in a suit, shake hands with businessmen and pretend you’re a celebrity at real estate events, you have what it takes to be a professional foreigner in China. Apparently, there is a certain level of prestige attached to an event if a foreigner attends it. Chinese businesses will pay token foreigners anywhere from $1,000 to $1,600 per week to do just that. Other than a bit of charisma and a clean appearance, no actual work is required for this “professional” role.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-professional-cuddler><strong>9. Professional Cuddler</strong></h2><p>Here’s another job that will let you stay in bed all day, as long you don’t mind some company. Thanks to apps like Cuddlr and Cuddle Comfort (think Tinder strictly for snuggle bunnies), careers in professional cuddling are on the rise. Cuddling services are currently available in 16 states. Professional cuddlers are charging up to $80 per hour and as much as $300 for an overnight session. As of now, no specific training or licensing is required for the position. All you need is a passion for spooning, squeezing and tickling complete strangers.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-teach-english-in-china><strong>8. Teach English in China</strong></h2><p>Via www.ytravelblog.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teaching &nbsp;is another high-paying, cushy job available to foreigners in China. There is such a high demand for English-speaking teachers in China that hiring standards are incredibly low. Many schools are more than willing to overlook a candidate’s prior experience – or lack thereof. Teachers are often hired, even without a relevant degree, certification or teaching experience, simply because they speak English. What’s more, teachers make good money in China and they can work as much or as little as they like. Foreign instructors make at least three times more than highly-educated local Chinese teachers working in the same schools.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-hotel-sleep-tester><strong>7. Hotel Sleep Tester</strong></h2><p>Via www.businessinsider.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, there’s a job that actually encourages you to sleep in. A professional sleep tester is quite literally a dream job. As wacky as it sounds, the job is not as uncommon as you might think. Sleep testers&nbsp;might work directly for a hotel, trying out the accommodations to ensure that guests have a restful stay. A test sleeper might also be employed by a third party, such as a travel website. In that case, testers usually remain anonymous and won't let on that they are there to access the amenities. Afterwards, they review their experience at a particular hotel, taking things like comfort and cleanliness into consideration.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-beer-taster><strong>6. Beer Taster</strong></h2><p>Not only can you drink on the job, you’ll get paid to do it if you’re a professional beer taster. That said, it involves more than simply tipping back a brew and saying whether it’s good or not. Professional beer testers must have a discerning palette and be able to identify a beer’s unique texture. For example, they need to know whether it’s malty or hoppy, pale versus thick, etc. A degree isn’t mandatory, but there are many online companies offering courses and certification in craft beer technology. Testers usually receive on-the-job training, typically at a brewery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-video-game-tester><strong>5. Video Game Tester</strong></h2><p>Via http://www.jobgametester.com/</p><p>Video game testing is a pretty sweet gig, particularly for couch-potato champions. On average, video game testers can earn anywhere from $10 to $18 per hour - about $30,000 a year on average. More seasoned testers, with six years or more of experience under their belts, could see a salary of approximately $71,000 per year. For the job, testers are essentially asked to try and break the game. They must also report any glitches, bugs or other issues they encounter during their “play” sessions.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-sleep-study-participant><strong>4. Sleep Study Participant</strong></h2><p>Here is yet another job that allows you to get paid while you sleep. Medical facilities are constantly conducting sleep studies and seeking people to participate in them. Each study is usually specific to age and lifestyle, so be sure to read the requirements carefully before you apply. Some studies require hospital stays. Sleep study participants can earn as much as $1,000 per day, but the pay rate varies. One woman who participated in two studies at the same time at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston earned $12,000 in 31 days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-computer-programmer><strong>3. Computer Programmer</strong></h2><p>Experts say the work is pretty easy, providing you’re good at it. The key to being an efficient programmer is to write as little code as possible. In this profession, doing less is the very nature of the job. On top of a sweet paycheck, working from home might be another perk of computer programming. If you’re smart but work-shy, you could be the perfect candidate for a job at Microsoft. Co-founder <a href=#>Bill Gates </a>is a big proponent of taking the easy way out. He has often quoted Hlade’s Law to echo his own opinion on the subject: “I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job, because he will find an easy way to do it."</p><p></p><h2 id=2-movie-extra><strong>2. Movie Extra&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Via www.supercompressor.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the extras you see on film sets are legitimate actors hoping for their big break, but others are in it for the quick cash. Non-union movie extras can earn up to about $100 per day, but rates vary depending on the type of production. If you’re a member of the Screen Actors Guild, you can earn a minimum of $150 per day. SAG extras are also entitled to substantial overtime pay. If a workday lasts longer than the standard eight hours, extras receive time and a half or double pay. In addition, SAG members often get extra money if they bring their own props, clothing and vehicles for use in the film.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-dog-walker><strong>1. Dog Walker</strong></h2><p>Some physical labor is required for this job, but it probably wouldn’t kill you to take Fido around the block a few times. A dog walker can make as much as $50 per hour, and that rate can increase exponentially depending on how many pets you take on. Owners are often willing to pay a premium to have someone walk their dogs while they're out of town or at work. Most states don’t require dog walkers to have a license and liability insurance, but you'll be more marketable and free from legal woes if you do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>www.stuff.co.nz</a>;&nbsp;<a href=#>www.dailymail.co.uk</a>;&nbsp;<a href=#>www.wsj.com</a>;&nbsp;<a href=#>www.lifedaily.com</a>;<a href=#>www.coupay.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62jnrumv9JoaGllmJ60qbHSrWSpmameu6h5yaiZrGWWpL9uuMCzsGaolaS9rbGO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beyonce-revealed-who-her-best-friend-is-and-it-s-not-kelly-rowland.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beyonce Revealed Who Her Best Friend Is, And It's Not Kelly Rowland">&larr;
