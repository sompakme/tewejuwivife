This is a character that first made its way to the big screen back in the '50s. Since then, the role has been famously portrayed by the likes of George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Brandon Routh, Tom Welling, and <a href=#>Henry Cavill who has been playing the Man of Steel in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU)</a>.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Superman & Lois’ Follows Clark Kent And Lois Lane As Modern Parents</a></span>Superman also continues to be alive and well on television with actor Tyler Hoechlin appearing as Clark Kent across various DC Comics shows for The CW. More recently, he’s been starring in <a href=#>the network’s most recent TV spinoff Superman & Lois</a>. And while it looks like Hoechlin will be donning a cape in the years to come, one can’t help but wonder how the California native really feels about portraying such a recognizable superhero, especially when <a href=#>former Supermen like Brandon Routh have struggled in their roles</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tyler-hoechlin-tried-out-for-superman-previously>Tyler Hoechlin Tried Out For Superman Previously</h2><p>Hoechlin first rose to fame after starring alongside Tom Hanks in the Oscar-winning crime drama Road to Perdition when he was only nine years old. He then went on to pursue a pro baseball career, but an injury eventually derailed his athletic dreams. Since then, the actor has been more focused on acting, booking other roles in film, as well as on television.</p><p>As he got older, Hoechlin also landed the part of Derek Hale in the MTV series Teen Wolf. Around this time, he became interested in pursuing another fantasy role. It just so happens that Zack Snyder was looking for the next Superman as he was putting together the cast for DCEU’s Man of Steel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without any hesitation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoechlin went for it</a>, bringing with him his personal interpretation of the famous superhero. “I remember getting those sides, and because of who the character was, I went into looking at those scenes with an idea of what it was either supposed to be or should feel like,” he recalled.</p><p>“And I remember looking at the pages and going, ‘my gut instinct is telling me something completely different than what I think they’re looking for.’ I just decided, ‘You know what? If this is what they’re wanting and hoping that I do in this scene, I’m going to do what my gut’s telling me. I’m going to commit to that.'”</p><p>Eventually, the role went to Cavill. Nonetheless, Hoechlin doesn’t have any regrets. “I’d so much rather go in and not get a job for doing it the way that I felt instinctually [sic] I really wanted to play it than to go in and get that job,” he explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unbeknownst to Hoechlin, he would encounter the role again just a few years later. Even better, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he didn’t need to audition</a> this time around. “I had a great meeting with [executive producers] Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg [in June]. I had been told that the meeting would have something to do with Supergirl, but nothing really specific,” the actor recalled.</p><p>“Halfway through, they brought up the idea of introducing Superman to the show and asked if I'd be interested.” Meanwhile, Kreisberg himself later revealed that they had been eyeing Hoechlin all along. “Greg [Berlanti] and I have wanted to work with Tyler for ages, so this worked out perfectly because Tyler is Superman,” he told Entertainment Weekly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-tyler-hoechlin-really-feel-about-being-superman>How Does Tyler Hoechlin Really Feel About Being Superman?</h2><p>After several years of playing the Man of Steel on television, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoechlin does feel like he understands the character a lot more</a>. “I feel like I understand a lot about Clark and Superman. Obviously not the powers, I wish I knew what it was like to fly — that would be great,” the actor remarked.</p><p>“But he does the right thing when there’s no reason other than ‘Why not?’ My folks raised us that way. I know you don’t have to do the right thing all the time — but it doesn’t make sense to me why you wouldn’t.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>New ‘Superman & Lois’ Still Sees Tyler Hoechlin In His Superman Suit</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hoechlin also said that he can relate to the character’s "eternal optimism." "I enjoy waking up in the morning and hoping that we will get there. Wherever there is that we’re hoping…so I appreciate that about him," he added.</p><p>And just like the last time he tried out for Superman, Hoechlin still prefers to stick to his instincts when approaching the character. “I’ve intentionally stayed away [from Superman since getting the role],” the actor explained. “I’ve found it more beneficial to have an impulse and trust it without the hesitation of, ‘Oh, so-and-so already did that.’ It makes it easier to just go do my thing without overthinking it.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tyler Hoechlin Almost Played Edward Cullen + 9 Other Facts About The New Superman</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor also appreciates that his current show, Superman & Lois, isn’t exactly focused on Superman being a hero. Instead, he likes the idea of a caped superhero trying to be the best father possible. “It’s fun to play with that and see who they really are in those more intimate moments, when they’re not playing this character for the world,” Hoechlin explained.</p><p>The CW recently announced that Superman & Lois has already been renewed for a third season. That essentially means Hoechlin won’t be going anywhere as far as being a superhero is concerned.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Madonna Turned Down The Role Of This Iconic DC Comics Character</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsG6uMSrZKGnlZi1rbXNZp%2Baq12orqqwjJqZqK2kYsC2vMSrpJqmXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./maia-campbell-declines-ll-cool-j-s-help-i-m-doing-good.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maia Campbell Declines LL Cool J's Help: 'I'm Doing Good'">&larr;
