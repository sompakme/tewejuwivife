So, it was such a huge shock when it was announced he was leaving. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">After season 3 he will be replaced by Liam Hemsworth</a>, a decision which seemingly came out of nowhere for fans and industry insiders alike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I really enjoy playing these kind of games and reading these kinds of books in my spare time," he said in 2009. "I don’t consider it a job," Cavill continued. "For me it is more like an extraordinary opportunity to live my childhood and adult life fantasies."</p><p>So what happened to make Henry Cavill quit a show and character he loved playing so much?</p><h2 id=liam-hemsworth-taking-over-as-geralt-in-the-witcher><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Liam Hemsworth Taking Over As Geralt In The Witcher</span></h2><p>On October 29, 2022, Netflix revealed that The Witcher's Geralt has been recast for season four with The Hunger Games actor Liam Hemsworth now set to star as the White Wolf.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an official statement following the shocking news, Hemsworth revealed that he's "over the moon" about the opportunity to play the lead character. He admitted he has "some big boots to fill," and for most viewers, it's impossible to imagine anyone other than Henry Cavill in the role.</p><p>"As a Witcher fan I’m over the moon about the opportunity to play Geralt of Rivia. Henry Cavill has been an incredible Geralt, and I’m honoured that he’s handing me the reins and allowing me to take up the White Wolf’s blades for the next chapter of his adventure," the Australian actor wrote on his Instagram.</p><h2 id=henry-cavill-graciously-said-goodbye-to-the-witcher><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Henry Cavill Graciously Said Goodbye To The Witcher</span></h2><p>Henry Cavill was ever the gentleman in his statement to the casting news:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf. As with the greatest of literary characters, I pass the torch with reverence for the time spent embodying Geralt and enthusiasm to see Liam's take on this most fascinating and nuanced of men. Liam, good sir, this character has such a wonderful depth to him, enjoy diving in and seeing what you can find."</p><h2 id=did-henry-cavill-like-starring-in-the-witcher><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Did Henry Cavill Like Starring In The Witcher?</span></h2><p>Henry Cavill once told THR that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was prepared to stay as Geralt for the whole seven seasons.</a></p><p>Cavill said he was happy to play Geralt for "as long as we can keep telling great stories which honour [author Andrzej] Sapkowski’s work."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Henry Cavill's Life Before Becoming Geralt In 'The Witcher,' Explained">Henry Cavill's Life Before Becoming Geralt In 'The Witcher,' Explained</a></span></p><p>"I’m a huge fan of the books and staying loyal to them," Cavill explained on The Witcher's YouTube channel. "It’s about making sure that story happens without too much in the way of diversions or side things going on to muddy the waters."</p><p>So maybe something in season 4 made Cavill uncomfortable or left him feeling like the show was going in the wrong direction?</p><h2 id=was-there-tension-between-henry-cavill-and-the-witcher-showrunner><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Was There Tension Between Henry Cavill And The Witcher Showrunner?</span></h2><p>As much as Henry Cavill loved Geralt and the source material, people believe they may be been tension between the Enola Holmes actor and The Witcher showrunner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to sources, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cavill had considered leaving the drama</a> during Season 2's post-production stage. There were reports that suggested Cavill was not happy with the show's direction and that he did not see eye to eye with the producers, with a recast considered as a possibility.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Does Henry Cavill Use A Double For His Stunts On 'The Witcher'?">Does Henry Cavill Use A Double For His Stunts On 'The Witcher'?</a></span></p><p>During the Season 2 press tour, Cavill’s genuine love of the character and showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich’s vision for the series appeared to differ.</p><p>Hissrich revealed that Cavill sent her several notes about Geralt’s dialogue for Season 2. “Everybody came out of Season 1 laughing and loving Geralt’s fuming. But Henry was saying that when you read the books you spend a lot of time in Geralt’s head. So how can we put that on the page?” Hissrich explained whilst promoting the sophomore season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=henry-cavil-concerned-tv-version-of-geralt-was-simple><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Henry Cavil Concerned TV Version Of Geralt Was Simple</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Cavill noted that the Netflix version of the character was far less complicated than the book version</a>. In the book, he often philosophizes about ethics and the line between good and evil. The show has made Geralt's character much more about delivering a morose monologue, snarky jokes and grunting his way through adventures.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Truth About How 'The Witcher' Was Created">The Truth About How 'The Witcher' Was Created</a></span></p><p>“It’s important for me to have the character be three-dimensional,” Cavill explained in December 2021. “And it’s tricky to do, as I was saying earlier, because there’s a certain vision and there’s a certain set storyline and plot. And so, it was about me trying to find Geralt’s place within that. All of my asks and requests were along the lines of just being faithful to the source material.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-henry-cavill-hint-at-his-departure-from-the-witcher><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Did Henry Cavill Hint At His Departure From The Witcher?</span></h2><p>Fans believe Henry Cavill may have commented about the recasting situation a few days ago in his interview with Josh Horowitz. He spoke about the importance of having belief in what you’re doing in your career and the importance of stopping when you believe what you’re doing is wrong.</p><p>“It’s just about belief. If you believe what you’re doing then you’ll be able to keep on doing it. It’s also important to know that if you realize you’re doing the wrong thing, that’s when you stop doing the wrong thing. You don’t just keep on going just because. Because that leads down a dark path.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cavill doesn’t name The Witcher, but it is easy to assume that he used this philosophy on the Netflix show.</p><h2 id=will-henry-cavill-be-back-as-superman><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Will Henry Cavill Be Back As Superman?</span></h2><p>The news of the recast comes at the same time as <a href=#>Henry Cavill returning as Superman</a>.
