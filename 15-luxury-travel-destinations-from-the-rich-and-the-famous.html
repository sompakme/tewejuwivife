A-list superstars spend a long time working and despite what people think, they put it in a lot of hours. From far away beaches and cities to crystal blue oceans or snowy mountains, celebrities certainly know how to travel.&nbsp;And, with all the dollars in the world, these super stars are able to go anywhere they want, with money as a non issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, many of these celebrities have their own private planes as well as numerous houses and apartments all over the world. So&nbsp;what's so good about travelling? With health doctors stating that travelling has enormous health benefits, it seems A-listers all over the world are cashing in on their doctors claims.

And, if that wasn't enough, extensive travelling also helps with your creative flow. That's right, the brain is influenced by environment and experience, thus rendering travel a great incentive.</p><p>So, while most of us can't even afford a trip to the nearest town, the next best thing is seeing how Hollywood A-Listers love to travel. Here are&nbsp;15 hot new travel destinations from the rich and the famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=los-cabos-mexico><strong>Los Cabos, Mexico</strong></h2><p>Cabo has been hot on the celebrity radar since like forever, especially during the 40s and 50s. That's right, an A-List celebrity attraction, Los Cabos, Mexico, is just a 2 hour plane ride from Los Angeles, meaning easy access and limited travel time.</p><p>Throughout its existence as a major celebrity hub, the luxurious beach resort has pulled in superstars such as John Wayne, Ernest Hemmingway, and modern day celebrities such as <a href=#>George Clooney</a> and <a href=#>Jenifer Aniston</a> to its beautiful shores. In fact, Cabo holds a number of world-class resorts and luxury hotels, and is often voted the most beautiful holiday destination in the world. So what are you waiting for? Hop on that plane and you might just bump into an A-lister or ten.</p><h2 id=st-barths-caribbean><strong>St. Barths,&nbsp;</strong><b>Caribbean</b></h2><p>Mostly famed for its terrifying airport and death trap runway, Saint Barthélemy is located in the West Indies. Often shortened to just, St Barths, by the rich and famous, the island is one of the most popular in the region. The island, which is surrounded by shallow reefs, also holds a volcano as well as number of other fascinating features.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Extremely popular during the Christmas and new year period, St. Barths is the number one winter holiday hot spot. Throughout its lifetime, St. Barths has had a firm friendship with the upper classes. From Great Garbo and Howard Hughes during the early days, to <a href=#>Ellen</a> and Portia of the latter days, St. Barths is now more renowned for the likes of <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and her noisy sisters. It was here where Kim Kardashian first revealed her baby bump, and where the whole family were snapped parasailing.</p><h2 id=havana-cuba><b>Havana</b><strong>, Cuba</strong></h2><p>Only very recently has Cuba become a tourist destination for the superstars of the USA, with travel restrictions and bans heavily imposed since the 60s. However, once a place for smelly European backpackers and over friendly Canadians, Havana, Cuba is now home to a number of American tourists who have been allowed entry into one of the most intriguing places in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, just ten months after the USA and Cuba declared the end of their big huge hostile bust-up, the Havana tourist industry dramatically changed. Attracting the likes of&nbsp;<a href=#>Jay Z </a>and <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>, the Kardashians, <a href=#>Mick Jagger</a>, <a href=#>Katy Perry</a> and <a href=#>Rihanna</a>, it seems the Havana enterprise will never quite be the same again.</p><h2 id=st-moritz-switzerland><strong>St. Moritz, Switzerland</strong></h2><p>It's not all about sunshine and sand! Fixed on the southern slopes of the Albula Alps, Switzerland, St. Moritz is one of the number one hot ski destinations in the entire world. Extremely old, the town was discovered almost 3,000 years ago, and was the location of the first electric light in 1878 and has the privilege of holding the first ski lift in 1935.</p><p>A renowned hot spot for the rich and famous, the resort was also famously used as a location for James Bond movies, The Spy who Loved Me, and A View to a Kill.&nbsp;Especially famous over the Christmas period, the ski town has been the host to a number of A-listers. That's right, from Academy Award winner <a href=#>Hilary Swank</a>, to the Royal Princes, William and Harry, St. Moritz is open only to the highest of the elite.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mallorca-spain><b></b><strong>Mallorca, Spain</strong></h2><p>The largest island in the Balearic Islands, Spain, Mallorca (sometimes spelt Majorca) is popular with the upper classes as well as the lower classes. Extremely popular with tourists, especially those from the UK and Germany, the island also plays host to some famous celebs.</p><p>That's right, not only is it popular with Spanish superstars such as Tennis legend, Rafa Nadal, but Hollywood has also become interested too. Celebrities such as <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>, <a href=#>Micheal Douglas</a> and, yep him again, George Clooney, are often spotted relaxing in resorts, or swimming in the crisp Mediterranean ocean. With blistering temperatures and a rocking cuisine, it is no surprise to see Mallorca nearing the top spot for the rich and the famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lake-como-italy><strong>Lake Como, Italy</strong></h2><p>Located in Lombardy, Italy, Lake Como is the third largest lake in Italy as well as one of the deepest in the whole of Europe. A popular destination for the wealthy elite, Lake Como has played host to the likes of aristocrats, royalty and Hollywood A-listers. Named the most beautiful lake in the world by The Huffington Post in 2014, the lake has often been praised for its micro-climate and&nbsp;prestigious villas and villages.</p><p>In 2002, the lake really made a name for itself when George Clooney bought an £8 million mansion situated on the lakeside village of Laglio. A huge fan of the area, Clooney now spends up to a whopping four months of every year hanging out beside the lake with wife Amal, and their two children.</p><h2 id=telluride-usa><strong>Telluride, USA</strong></h2><p>Situated in the southwestern portion of the U.S state of Colorado, Telluride has swiftly become one of the most famous ski resorts for the rich and famous. A former mining town, the town was named Telluride due to the gold telluride minerals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only is the famous town a popular holiday hot sport for celebrities worldwide, but also home to many. In fact, woman of the moment, <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> just purchased 60 acres of land for a whopping $10.8 million dollars. From <a href=#>Don Cheadle</a> to <a href=#>Bill Murray</a>, some of Hollywood's biggest A-Listers reside here, with <a href=#>Jessica Biel</a> recently setting up shop as well as <a href=#>Amy Adams</a>. And that's not all, with <a href=#>Kevin Costner</a> also reported to love the town so much that he has asked to be buried there.</p><h2 id=the-hamptons-usa><strong>The Hamptons, USA</strong></h2><p>Probably one of the most recognisable places in the world, The Hamptons has been accommodating the rich and famous for a long amount of time. Located on the east of Long Island, the Hamptons is formed by the towns of Southampton and East Hampton.</p><p>A popular place for those who wish to seek refuge from the big city, the Hamptons are exceptionally busy during the summer period. In fact, the Hamptons is heaving with so many A-listers, that it is likely you will bump into one just while walking down the street. A&nbsp;number of wealthy celebrities have holiday homes that are mostly located along the ocean front. That's right, from <a href=#>Eli Manning</a>, <a href=#>Calvin Klein</a>, and <a href=#>Brooke Shields</a>, to Kelly Ripa and Howard Stern, the Hamptons has it all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=palmizana-hvar-croatia><strong>Palmizana, Hvar, Croatia</strong></h2><p>Still very much undiscovered to tourists all around the world, Croatia has somehow managed to stay off the tourist map for some time. However, with more and more people finding out about the beautiful beaches and cheap prices, it seems Croatia won't stay quiet for much longer. It is Hvar in particular that proves popular with the upper classes, with the island playing host to superstars such as <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Roman Abramovich</a>,&nbsp;and <a href=#>Giorgio Armani</a>.</p><p>Plus, the island even attracts royalty, with <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> a regular visitor to the famous nightclubs and bars that are located on the island's ocean front. Throughout history the island has been a favoured location, with Mrs JF Kennedy spotted water-skiing back in 1964. So what are you waiting for? Go before it gets too crowded!</p><h2 id=paradise-beach-mykonos-island-greece><strong>Paradise Beach, Mykonos Island, Greece</strong></h2><p>It's not all about relaxing and sunbathing on the beach, sometimes a celebrity just wants to let loose a little. The Greek island of&nbsp;Mykonos does just that, drawing a number of A-listers from all over the world each year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the last decade alone, superstars such as <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, <a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a>, <a href=#>Tobey Maguire</a>, Alessandra Ambrosia, <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>, <a href=#>Gerard Butler</a>, Kim Kardashian, <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>, and <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> were all spotted on the island, and that's to name but a few. Now somewhat of a rival to the number one party island that is Ibiza, Mykonos is a serious contender. So much so, <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> opened a nightclub in nearby city Athens, just so she could visit the neighbouring island more regularly. With its crystal clear water and epic nightlife, Mykonos is most definitely on the up.</p><h2 id=saint-tropez-france><strong>Saint Tropez, France</strong></h2><p>Located on the French Riviera, Saint Tropez is mostly known for its beautiful beaches and A-lister company. Throughout its history, the resort has been highly popular with the wealthy elite, as well as playing host to a number of artists during the French New Wave cinema movement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is extremely likely that you'll spot a celebrity coasting the mighty waters, superstars such as Noel Gallagher, <a href=#>Bono</a> and the Kardashian's are regular visitors. But&nbsp;the&nbsp;one woman in particular who has become synonymous with the seaside town,&nbsp;is <a href=#>Brigitte Bardot</a>. She is credited for creating the town rather than just being a regular guest. That's right, starring in hit movie, And God Created Women, which was filmed in Saint Tropez, Bardot and the town instantly became popular as a result.</p><h2 id=ibiza-spain><strong>Ibiza, Spain</strong></h2><p>One of the most famous holiday destinations in the world, Ibiza has been the ultimate party island for years. Located off the east coast of Spain in the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea, Ibiza is known for its nightlife, electronic music and summer party scene. However, that's not all it is known for, with the island often voted one of the most beautiful places in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's right, it's not all partying and alcohol, with tourists often visiting for the scenery rather than that of the partying lifestyle. Plus, a number of celebrities have their own holiday homes situated on the island, with some visiting every summer for months at a time. Yep, celebrities with holiday villas include, superstar DJ <a href=#>David Guetta</a>, <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>, <a href=#>Shakira</a>, <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, Jade Jagger and <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone</a>.</p><h2 id=goldeneye-resort-jamaica><strong>Goldeneye Resort, Jamaica</strong></h2><p>Not only is Jamaica's Goldeneye Resort one of the most beautiful places in the world, but it's also the birthplace of James Bond. That's right, the Goldeneye is the former estate of Bond creator and author, Ian Fleming, and the place in which Fleming wrote all 14 James Bond novels. How cool is that?</p><p>Now playing host to a number of celebrities, the resort is the cream of the crop when it comes the upper classes and those who can afford it, because yet it is very expensive. A true superstar magnet, the hotel attracts guests such as Jay-Z, Beyoncé, and <a href=#>Kate Moss</a>, with Jay-Z referring to the resort as a "hideout to visit". In fact, it was also reported that pop legend, Sting, wrote popular hit, "every breath you take" in one of the rooms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-maldives><strong>The Maldives</strong></h2><p>Located in the Indian Ocean, The Maldives is one of the most popular vacation destinations for the rich and the famous. But why? Tropical in nature, the island is known for its blistering beaches, blue lagoons and exceptionally long reefs. However, its main attraction is that of its hidden nature.</p><p>That's right, a massive hot spot for movie stars and Royals who just want to remain incognito, the Maldives is the perfect spot due to how isolated it is. Playing host to a number of celebrities especially over Christmas, the Beckhams in particular are known to spend at least two weeks sunning themselves in the scorching sun over the holiday period. And if that wasn't good enough, John Legend proposed to wife <a href=#>Chrissy Teigen </a>while holidaying there on a romantic break.</p><h2 id=rio-de-janeiro-brazil><strong>Rio De Janeiro, Brazil</strong></h2><p>Rio de Janeiro is one of the most famous cities in Brazil and the entire world. In fact, Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere, mostly due to its tropical weather and plucky atmosphere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Famed for things such as Carnival, Samba, white beaches and crystal clear waters, it is no surprise to see celebrities far and wide flocking to the fun and exciting bustling city. One hotel in particular is also famous for its high interest in celebrities, with&nbsp;Copacabana Palace a hit with the rich and the famous. Hosting superstars such as Madonna, the Rolling Stones, Kim and Kayne and <a href=#>Will Smith</a>, to name but a few, the hotel is a must for those celebrities who want to reach the big time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmraqRq7Kte5BuZJqlka%2B2r7OMramarpWheretwpqroqeeYrGmv9OipZqsmaS7tHnFq6amZaSdsm6%2ByJyfZpmemXq1tMRmnZqln6rAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-birdman-andersen-s-catfish-opens-up-to-nev-and-max-recap.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris &amp;quot;Birdman&amp;quot; Andersen's Catfish Opens Up To Nev and Max: Recap">&larr;
