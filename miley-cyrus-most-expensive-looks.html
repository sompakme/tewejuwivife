And it's been a true journey for those who began as fans of beloved Disney show&nbsp;Hannah Montana&nbsp;to see the evolution of the singer. With such a long and prosperous career behind her, and many more decades of success sure to follow, it's no wonder that Miley has managed to keep her bank account looking like something most of us could only dream of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley knows exactly how to live the life on an international millionaire pop stars. Whether we're talking about her insanely pricey hair extensions or her diamond nail polish, she has more than a few ideas about how to spend her money. And of course, her style is no exception. Let's take a look at Miley Cyrus' most expensive looks!</p><h2 id=2018-vanity-fair-oscar-party-look---5-342>2018 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Look - $5,342</h2><p>When it comes down to attending high-profile events, we always expect celebrities to look their best. And an event like the Vanity Fair Oscar Party is exactly one of those events where Hollywood A-listers go all out with their outfits.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Net Worth Of The 10 Biggest Disney Child Stars</a></span></p><p>In 2018, Miley arrived at the party wearing a stunning gown from Prabal Gurung that costs a whopping $3,195. Because accessorizing is everything, she made sure to take it far, sporting an&nbsp;Anne Sisteron 14KT White Gold Emerald Diamond Triple Cushion Cut Luxe Cocktail Ring, retailing for&nbsp;$1,640.00 and&nbsp;Stella McCartney Silk Satin Sandals, which go for&nbsp;$507.00.

Even though we're used to seeing the starlet stroll around in relatively casual and country-inspired outfits, there are instances where she also blesses the cameras with expensive looks.</p><p>Such as this one she was wearing when leaving her hotel in London. Cyrus was wearing&nbsp;a Vince Pima Turtleneck Tee, retailing at $95.00,&nbsp;Gucci Stretch Viscose Pant with Double G, with a&nbsp;$1,215.00 price tag, a vintage Chanel Satin Evening Bag from her personal collection, selling for&nbsp;$4,925.00, Sydney Evan Gold & Diamond Safety Pin Earrings, setting her back&nbsp;$660.00, and Public Desire Porter Staple Pointed Toe-Ankle Boots, at $17.99.</p><h2 id=2018-grammy-awards-look---8-249-99>2018 Grammy Awards Look - $8,249.99</h2><p>If singing and producing music is how you make your millions, then you better make sure that you let everybody at the Grammy Awards know exactly who you are.

And paired with&nbsp;Akira Rhinestone Round Chunky-Heel Platform Sandals at&nbsp;$49.99, the overall look reaches $8,249.99.</p><h2 id=the-wedding-look---8-600>The Wedding Look - $8,600</h2><p>What girl doesn't want to look her best on the most special day of her life?

Retailing at $8,600, it's far from being the most expensive wedding dress we've ever seen, but it's still quite a hefty price tag. Plus, she looked absolutely beautiful!</p><h2 id=26th-annual-academy-awards-viewing-party-look---9-000>26th Annual Academy Awards Viewing Party Look - $9,000</h2><p>We can only imagine what it feels like to attend an Elton John party.

But that didn't keep this outfit from reaching the $9,000 mark, thanks to the Sydney Evan Large White-Gold PavÃ© Diamond Starburst Drop Earrings, costing&nbsp;$5,300.00, plus the&nbsp;Gucci Feline Face Minaudiere Clutch, with a price tag of&nbsp;$3,700.00.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bbc-radio-two-visit-look---9-766>BBC Radio Two Visit Look - $9,766</h2><p>As an internationally renowned pop-star, Miley has to attend a fair share of events and music-related appearances.
