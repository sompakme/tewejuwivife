Her last film was Easy A in 2010 and then her life turned for the worse. She was suffering from mental illness and substance abuse.She was a 2000s icon and was on almost every TV during that time. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But since her breakdown in 2012</a>, she has not acted. In fact, after her parents stepped in and helped her get sober, Bynes enrolled in school to study fashion. She had hoped to make her own fashion line. However, nothing has come to fruition yet.Bynes then went into rehab and met someone there. Then, Amanda joined Instagram and told her followers some good news. She later claimed<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she was engaged</a> and pregnant but the pregnancy turned out to be just a rumor. Since then, she has been pretty calm.It may only be halfway through the year, but here's what Amanda Bynes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has been up to in 2021.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=celebrated-her-35th-birthday><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><span class=related-single>Celebrated Her 35th Birthday</span></span></h2><p>It's hard to believe Amanda Bynes is 35, because we've seen her as a child and young adult in movies, but when a decade goes by, this is what happens. On April 3, she celebrated her 35th birthday with family and friends, according to her lawyer David A. Esquibias. He talked to PEOPLE and told the magazine that the former actress is "doing great." Not much else is known about the celebration.</p><h2 id=released-a-rap-song><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Released A Rap Song</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the beginning of January, Bynes added another thing to her resume- rapping. She posted a short snippet of the song called "Diamonds" to her Instagram and YouTube channel. In the one-minute clip, she is heard to be rapping with rapper Precise, who is believed to be her fiancé Paul Michael. He also posted a video of him singing the song on his TikTok. She seems to be singing on the chorus, "Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds / On my neck / On my wrist / Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds." Although she released the teaser the song was never put on streaming platforms.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Are All The (Good And Bad) Things We Have Forgotten About Amanda Bynes</a></span></p><h2 id=enjoying-soul-cycle-classes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Enjoying Soul Cycle Classes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to her lawyer, he told PEOPLE that "she lives by the beach, attends school and is enjoying mediation and Soul Cycle classes."

The couple doesn't live together, and the pandemic was hard on them. They even broke off their engagement for a few months, but are now back together. He is supposedly a great influence on her and is an advocate for her sobriety and is a nice person, according to unnamed sources.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Few Facts People Know About Amanda Bynes Before She Became Famous</a></span></p><h2 id=she-is-under-a-conservatorship><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Is Under A Conservatorship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Like Britney Spears,</a> Amanda Bynes has been under a conservatorship for many years. Her mother currently has complete control over her affairs and finances, and she has since Bynes started having legal problems, which landed her in a mental health facility. That means that Amanda is unable to marry her fiancé, unless she has her mother's permission. Her mother has refused her to marry Paul Michael, saying she doesn't believe Amanda is in any capacity to make decisions about her care or treatment.

Although she has not posted anything since 2019, her Twitter is still up. Bynes made an official Instagram account last year, but wipes it every few months. She used to update her 25k followers with her life and selfies she would take, showing them that she got a face tattoo and nose ring. But currently, the account is empty. No one knows if that means she spiraled again, or if she just wants privacy and posted those when she was not in a good place.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things Nickelodeon Fans Forgot About Jeannette McCurdy</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZJqlkaOxonnBsqWeq12drrR5wZ6cp2WlpXq1u4yipWZqYGd%2BcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kay-adams-husband-is-she-still-married-or-not.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kay Adams Husband: Is She Still Married Or Not?">&larr;
