This special run was on a place called Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, which is flat and covered in salt.</span></p><p><span>But here’s the thing: Michelle had some tough times in her athletic journey. Once, she hurt her ankle really badly while doing something called the long jump.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It was a super serious injury, and she never fully got better from it.
