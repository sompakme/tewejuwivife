Well, since then, she has just gone on to bigger and better things.</p><p>However, in the following, we're going to take a closer look back at that special interview between the two in 2014. At the start of the interview, Swift has an emotional moment given the response of the fans.

At the time, Swift was promoting her iconic album, 1989. The interview was also extra special given that she was living in New York, having just moved from Nashville. The interview instantly gets off to a great start as Taylor Swift is greeted with a warm reception from the audience, one that has Swift completely teary-eyed.</p><p>Letterman reacted to the standing ovation, "That's right. The crowd goes crazy. Taylor Swift." Letterman even gestures for the audience to settle down saying, "Okay, thank you."</p><p>"Wow, I like them," Swift responds. Letterman jokingly says that some of the reaction was meant for him as well. Dave then starts off the interview by showering Swift with praise for her work, something The Late Show host rarely did with other guests. His admiration for Swift was obvious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-24t112024-838.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>David Letterman Couldn't Believe The Treatment He Was Given In His Dressing Room Prior To His Interview With Stephen Colbert</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>David Letterman admitted things were completely different behind the scenes with Stephen Colbert in charge compared to his days.</span><p>The chemistry between Letterman and Swift is obvious throughout the chat. Swift would even discuss what it was like living in New York, just having moved there at the time.</p><p>"Any time I talk to anyone or any time I do an interview, I'm like, 'You don't understand. You have to go there now. You have to go to New York. Just drop what you're doing, and go there. It's amazing. It's the greatest place ever.' "And I guess the city picked up on that," Taylor continued jokingly. "She's the most enthusiastic, obnoxious person to ever love New York. She loves it with like 18 exclamation points afterward, underlined."</p><p>Letterman then asks if New York paid her to be an ambassador type of figure since making her move. Swift confirmed she was not paid for the move... Nonetheless, Swift is still clearly content with her decision as she still has a place in New York a decade later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-was-praised-by-the-fans-for-her-interview-with-david-letterman>Taylor Swift Was Praised By The Fans For Her Interview With David Letterman</h2><p>In the comments section on YouTube, it was nothing but love for Taylor Swift. The interview was posted on the Letterman YouTube channel a year ago. It was nothing but praise for Swift, especially given the way she handled herself throughout the discussion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-12.jpg><p>Fans wrote, "She literally got a couple minutes standing ovation for just walking out. This woman is out of this world." Another fan wrote, "The world desperately needs a role model like Taylor. As a senior, I see a moral decline in our society perpetuated by young "adults". Taylor is a breath of fresh air and a classy lady. I'm so glad that she is so willing to give so much of herself for the general welfare of all of us. Taylor is a poster child for human kindness.

But we wanted something special for this first show back, so we asked her on a complete whim, since she had been in town doing SNL. She said yes with zero hesitation,” DiCenzo wrote.</p><p>“She sang ‘New Year’s Day.’ No one had heard it. Suddenly she sings the line, ‘Squeeze my hand 3 times in the back of the taxi.’ I nearly gasped. Tears. I think everyone in the audience started sobbing. I could see Jimmy silhouetted at his desk dabbing his eyes with a tissue. We all lost it. It was a beautiful coincidence in a beautiful performance. ‘Hold on to your memories, they will hold on to you,’ Taylor sang.”</p><p>A great moment on The Tonight Show and one <strong><a href=#>Jimmy Fallon</a></strong> won't ever forget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llaK8tbXOp5ilZZSWw6qwjKWcrayVp7qiuoyipa2doqu2psOMoqWtqp9k</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-crystal-hefner-s-new-boyfriend-ryan-blake-malaty.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Crystal Hefner's New Boyfriend Ryan Blake Malaty?">&larr;
