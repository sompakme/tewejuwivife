On one hand, there is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Shelton</a>, who has been a long-running coach on&nbsp;The Voice, and on the other, there's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Clarkson</a>, who won the inaugural season of&nbsp;American Idol.&nbsp;These days, both of these music superstars are featured together as coaches on&nbsp;The Voice, but their relationship goes far beyond that of co-workers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The relationship between Kelly Clarkson and Blake Shelton stretches over many years, and features ties to the music industry as well as friends and family. These two have a great relationship, and now fans are able to see that on the screen each week. The real question is - just how deep does their relationship go?</p><h2 id=known-each-other-for-years><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Known Each Other For Years</strong></span></h2><p>Blake has amassed a very impressive music career over the past twenty years, which is actually around the same time Kelly won the first season of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Idol</a>. While their paths crossed professionally, they actually became more well-acquainted through mutual friends like Reba McIntyre. Their relationship is much deeper now, and almost like family, but they knew each other long before&nbsp;The Voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-voice-s-friendly-rivalry><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>The Voice's Friendly Rivalry</strong></span></h2><p>With such a close relationship comes all the great things that go along with it, including a friendly rivalry between two superstars of the music industry. Shelton is almost like The Voice royalty given his long-standing term as a judge on the show, but that does not stop Kelly from challenging him as often as possible. Regarding their rivalry, Shelton told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Magazine</a> that while Kelly is his friend, to "But when she’s on this show, she is my enemy".</p><h2 id=clarkson-s-husband-is-blake-s-manager><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Clarkson's Husband Is Blake's Manager</strong></span></h2><p>Being such big stars in the music industry has certainly bonded Clarkson and Shelton over the years, but they share an even bigger connection - family. While they are not related directly, they do business together so frequently that it almost makes them family. In fact, Blake's livelihood directly impacts Kelly's family since her husband is his talent manager.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Known Facts About Kelly Clarkson’s Time On American Idol</a></span></p><p>Brandon Blackstock has been Blake's manager through most of his career, which gives Kelly and Blake even more contact when they are not on&nbsp;The Voice together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-kids-love-blake><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Her Kids Love Blake</strong></span></h2><p>Kelly is the mother to four children - two of her own and two from her husband's previous marriage - and reportedly they all "love Blake". Clarkson told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Magazine</a> that Blake has a "gravitational pull" about him which draws others in. Blake's charm has always been one of his highly rated qualities, and apparently it even works on children as they love being around him!</p><h2 id=makes-appearances-on-her-talk-show><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Makes Appearances On Her Talk Show</strong></span></h2><p>Blake Shelton is always willing to help out a friend, even if it means appearing on day time television. Shelton has appeared twice on Kelly's talk show,&nbsp;The Kelly Clarkson Show, as both an interviewee and musical entertainment. Blake is never one to shy away from an opportunity to appear on television, but considering that this was a way to help the success of his friend's show, he jumped at the opportunity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-respects-his-choice-of-talent><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>She Respects His Choice Of Talent</strong></span></h2><p>While success after winning&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;is not guaranteed for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">winners of the show</a>, one thing is for sure - Blake Shelton pushes hard for them to have a great career once they have won. Clarkson is very admirable about this part of Blake's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">coaching philosophy</a>, and while they may be rivals on the screen, she appreciates now he "pushes for his artists". Blake loves the music business, and uses his influence as a judge to make sure great people succeed, and Clarkson aims for the same.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Voice Isn’t The Only Thing That Bumped Christina Aguilera’s Net Worth To $160 Million</a></span></p><h2 id=their-arguments-have-gone-a-bit-too-far><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Their Arguments Have Gone A Bit Too Far</strong></span></h2><p>Things may be sunshine and rainbows between the two most of the time, but sometimes their play-fighting can go a bit too far. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview for&nbsp;Extra TV</a>, what started out as a playful argument went a little too far and seemed to hurt some feelings. The two singers began bickering about a proposed Christmas song featuring the two that never came to pass, but something Blake said struck a nerve with Kelly and the argument became more heated than anyone expected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-almost-officiated-kelly-s-wedding><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Blake Almost Officiated Kelly's Wedding</strong></span></h2><p>Closeness between co-workers is one thing, but the relationship that Kelly and her husband have with Blake has almost become more than that. In certain states, Blake is an ordained minister and has officiated weddings for friends in the past, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trace Atkins</a>. So when his manager and Kelly Clarkson were getting married in 2011, he offered up his services, but things did not pan out.</p><h2 id=she-changed-her-judge-s-seat-to-be-away-from-him><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>She Changed Her Judge's Seat To Be Away From Him</strong></span></h2><p>Having friends by your side at work can be fun, but it can also become very taxing to not get a break from someone you know. Kelly knows this all too well - not only is Blake a close friend and a co-worker, but he was also situated directly beside her for all tapings of&nbsp;The Voice. However, Kelly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked not to be seated next to him</a> during her second season to create some distance between the two. While she still loves Blake, she stated she wanted the move so he&nbsp;"didn't annoy her as much".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-always-teases-her-about-talking-too-much><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>He Always Teases Her About Talking Too Much</strong></span></h2><p>The rivalry between Clarkson and Shelton on&nbsp;The Voice is one of the most enjoyable parts of the show when they are placed opposite each other. In fact, it even surpassed the rivalry between Adam Levine and Blake that was front and center for most of the show, particularly since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Levine's departure</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘The Voice’: Kelly Clarkson May Have Found A New Rival In Nick Jonas</a></span></p><p>During their first season competing against each other, Blake said that he would use his clout for winning against Kelly to make her&nbsp;"shut up for just five minutes". Complete fun and games, but poking fun&nbsp;at how much she talks is one of Blake's favourite pastimes.</p><h2 id=they-enjoy-performing-together><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>They Enjoy Performing Together</strong></span></h2><p>While Blake is well-cemented as a country artist and Kelly has been long considered a pop artist, that has not stopped the two from performing alongside each other. Mixing two big-name artists for a performance is certainly a money-making engine, and these to superstars see the potential for dollars when they are featured together. They have only performed a handful of times together on stage, but have both said it was very enjoyable and would love to do it again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-coached-her-on-how-to-choose-contestants><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Blake Coached Her On How To Choose Contestants</strong></span></h2><p>While Kelly has plenty of experience from&nbsp;American Idol on reality-singing competitions,&nbsp;The Voice was her first opportunity on the other side of the bench where she was judging would-be winners. While her abilities as a singer make her a natural coach, she was very nervous about&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">selecting contestants from their auditions</a>. Blake's coaching for her may have been poking fun of her at times, but he stood by her to get her through a tough moment in her career.</p><h2 id=he-has-more-the-voice-wins><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>He Has More 'The Voice' Wins</strong></span></h2><p>Since Blake has been with&nbsp;The Voice since the show began in the US in 2011 and Clarkson only for a short amount of time, he has amassed many more wins than her. In fact, Blake is the "winningest" coach in the show's history, having won a record seven times versus Kelly's three. Kelly has plenty of time to catch up, but don't think that Blake won't be holding his record over her head every step of the way!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Katy Perry And Other American Idol Judges Have Said About The Show</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dq7yqr8Rmoa6cl5rAbrfEpaOyZZOhrrO30qilZpmemXqjuMCknGarmJq5tbvNZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./paige-desorbo-and-craig-conover-s-relationship-timeline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paige DeSorbo and Craig Conovers Relationship Timeline">&larr;
