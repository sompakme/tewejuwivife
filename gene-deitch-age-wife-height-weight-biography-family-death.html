Deitch was an animator, producer and excellent film director.</p><p>Gene got the most recognition due to the famous cartoon characters Tom and Jerry. Also, his film Munro won the Academy Award in 1960 for Best Animated Short Film. Deitch was nominated for this award for the second time in 1964 as well.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wikicelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gene-Deitch-death.jpg decoding=async alt="Gene Deitch death" width=416 height=242 data-sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>According to sources, Gene Deitch died on Thursday-Friday night in his apartment in Prague. He died suddenly and no further information has been received about this but it is known that he was suffering from some disease of the intestine.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Childhood_Parents_Siblings_Education></span><strong>Childhood, Parents, Siblings & Education</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Everybody who has watched Gene’s creations loves him and now people want to know more about him and his early life. In 1924 (<strong>age 95 years; as in 2019</strong>), Gene Deitch was born in Chicago, Illinois, the U.S. He grew up in a financially stable family.</p><p>His father Joseph Deitch and mother Ruth Delson Deitch was a homemaker. We have no data about his siblings and as far as we came to know he was the only kid of his parents.</p><p>His schooling happened in Los Angeles. He attended Los Angeles High School and his high school graduation completed in the year 1942. From childhood, he had the habit of making creative illustrations and which in the future became his profession.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wedding_spouse_children></span><strong>Wedding, spouse & children</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>During his job at North American Aviation, he met a lady named Marie which further turned into a relationship when they married each other in the year 1943. The couple even has 3 kids named Seth Deitch, Kim Deitch and Simon Deitch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wikicelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gene-Deitch-death.jpg><p>When in 1959 he went to Prague, Czech Republic there he met Zdenka Najmanová who used to work as a production manager.</p><p>She became the reason why Gene Deitch made his mind to live in the Czech Republic permanently when their marriage took place in 1964. They spent 55 years of their happy married life living in Prague and this is where he spent his final time also.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Stats_Height_Weight_Appearance></span><strong>Physical Stats, Height, Weight & Appearance</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In his youth years, Gene Deitch used to be a charming man and used to wear glasses. On most of the occasions, he used to wear a business suit at his office. When he was 19 years old, just after completing his pilot training he caught pneumonia and this became the reason why he left his aviation job.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wikicelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gene-Deitch-in-young-days.jpg decoding=async alt="Gene Deitch in young days" width=383 height=411 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Before death, he was a 95 years old active man who was still filled with creativity.
