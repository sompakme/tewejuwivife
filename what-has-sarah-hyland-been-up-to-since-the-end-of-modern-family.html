It was hard not to become attached to the Pritchett/Delgado/Tucker family, as Phil and Claire were hilariously raising their three kids, Gloria and Jay didn't always understand each other, and Cam and Mitch were so charming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cam and Mitch's adorable daughter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lily is all grown up now</a>&nbsp;and it has been fun seeing what everyone has been up to since the show ended in the spring of 2020. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The cast was sad to say goodbye</a>&nbsp;and viewers felt the same way.</p><p>Sarah Hyland, who played Dunphy sibling Haley, is also a grown-up now. The 30-year-old actress spent so many years on the popular sitcom, and now fans are wondering what she has in store.</p><h2 id=starring-in-the-wedding-year>Starring In 'The Wedding Year'</h2><p>Since&nbsp;Modern Family&nbsp;just came to an end in April 2020, Sarah Hyland doesn't have many new roles, especially since the finale aired at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The actress does have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$14 million net worth from starring on the sitcom</a>.</p><p>But she did star in one movie that fans really enjoyed watching:&nbsp;The Wedding Year. This is her most recent project besides&nbsp;Modern Family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The romantic comedy was released in 2019 and stars Hyland as Mara, a photographer living in L.A. who doesn't dream about her wedding day like some people do. She and her boyfriend Jake (played by Tyler James Williams) go to so many weddings in a year that she starts to reconsider that stance.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyland said that she "always believed in marriage"</a>&nbsp;in an interview with&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter. The actress explained, "I, fortunately, have parents who are not divorced and who have had a very loving and healthy relationship from the get-go. So if you don’t believe in marriage, that was a big deal-breaker for me before I got engaged. It was a lot of fun to delve into the psychology of Mara's views because I didn't fully understand it. It was a lot of fun to be able to go into her ticks and see why she's wired the way that she is. I know a lot of people like that, so it was really fun to be able to talk about their experiences with their parents and really create this character."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hyland&nbsp;said that she loved shooting one scene at a wedding with a lot of dancing in it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Say This Is The Best Character From ‘Modern Family’</a></span></p><h2 id=wedding-planning>Wedding Planning</h2><p>There's one big thing that has happened in Sarah Hyland's personal life: in the summer of 2019, she and Wells Adams got engaged.</p><p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they decided to move their wedding to a later date. In June 2020,&nbsp;People&nbsp;reported that Hyland explained&nbsp;Chris Harrison that they didn't have a new plan in the works. She said, "No plans as of right now. We've put all planning on hold. All of my family is mostly on the East Coast, so for them to fly out ... and just ages and of course with my health risks, we want to be as safe as possible."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On their original wedding date, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">couple took adorable photos at a vineyard</a>. According to People,&nbsp;Adams wore a crisp white shirt and Hyland wore a white dress."A couple, a pandemic, & a postponed wedding: A series," Hyland began the caption of her post. "We were supposed to get married today. Instead... we took pictures and drank wine. I love you to Pluto & back @wellsadams Hyland&nbsp; wrote in her Instagram caption."</p><p>In September 2019, Hyland said that she was really looking forward to being married and that was more fun than planning the wedding. According to&nbsp;Us Weekly, she said, "I think the marriage part of it. People — I think a lot of mistakes that people make are [that] they’re excited to have a wedding and not a marriage."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Modern Family’: Are Sofia Vergara And Julie Bowen Still Friends?</a></span></p><h2 id=a-new-comedy>A New Comedy?</h2><p>According to&nbsp;Deadline, Sarah Hyland&nbsp;is attached to a project from Emily V.
