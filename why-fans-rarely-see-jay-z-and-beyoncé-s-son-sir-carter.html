Lastly, they enjoy the celebrity life while relishing a semblance of normalcy behind the cameras.</p><p>Nevertheless, this secrecy has a downside, as it also increases the public's curiosity, especially considering that <a href=#>Blue Ivy has begun to forge a music career</a>, and Rumi has even modeled for her mother's fashion brand Ivy Park; this also leaves fans debating why they rarely ever see the couple's son Sir.

The young star has attended several awards shows, concerts, basketball games and red carpet screenings alongside her famous parents.</p><p>However, Jay-Z and Beyoncé have kept Blue Ivy, as well as their other <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">two children's lives, as normal </a>as possible behind the glares of the camera.</p><p>"Expect the same kind of upbringing and life for the twins as Blue when it comes to privacy, being involved..." a source close to Beyoncé and Jay-Z told The Hollywood Life.</p><p>"Beyoncé won't change a thing about how they will be raised. You always learn things to do or not to do with your second baby, but her kids' privacy and raising them normal is something very important to her, no matter which child it is. She wants the best for all of her children."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The public is treated to the occasional glimpses of one of the twins, Sir Carter -- such as in a few paparazzi shots, Instagram photos and more recently, we got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a glimpse of the twins in Beyonce's Renaissance World Tour film, </a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé</a>. We also caught a glimpse of Sir in a feature in Beyoncé's "Black is King" visual album in which the songstress dedicated the album to, stating "... to my son, Sir Carter, and to all our sons and daughters, the sun and moon bow for you.

For example, the "Crazy in Love" singer stated she weighed slightly over 218 pounds the day she gave birth to her twins. She also said that throughout her pregnancy, she developed high blood pressure and preeclampsia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/untitled-design-2023-12-05t102006-806.jpg><p>Additionally, Beyoncé shockingly revealed the devastating news that in the delivery room, one of her twin's heartbeats stopped a few times in the womb, which forced doctors <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">to perform an emergency C-section</a>, as confirmed by The Daily Mail.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Beyoncé didn't specifically mention which one of her twins experienced the heart issues, it has long been rumored that the twin in question was Sir; this reason is why many fans believe Beyoncé and Jay-Z are more overprotective of Sir.</p><h2 id=what-have-jay-z-and-beyonc-eacute-said-about-their-three-kids>What Have Jay-Z And Beyoncé Said About Their Three Kids?</h2><p><strong>Jay-Z and Beyoncé appear to be very proud of their three children</strong>, perhaps particularly so given Beyoncé has been vocal about her struggles with conceiving.</p><p>While the couple doesn't give many interviews, on the rare occasions they do, inevitably, the topic of their children is brought up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jay-z-and-beyonce.jpg><p>For example, after <strong>Blue Ivy danced with Beyoncé during her 2023 Renaissance World Tour,</strong> Beyoncé later took to her Instagram account and posted a series of photographs of Blue Ivy.

I'm so proud and thankful to be your mama. You bring us so much joy, my sweet angel."</p><p>In an interview with Gayle King on the CBS Morning Show, Jay-Z praised Blue Ivy and opened up a bit about her upbringing: "... she's been born into a life she didn't ask for. Since she was born, she's been in, like, scrutiny, and public eye, and everyone having an opinion of a little girl, how she keeps her hair. For her to be on that stage and reclaim her power, and the song is called 'My Power,' you can't write a better script."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blue-ivy-and-jay-z.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for twins Rumi and Sir Carter, the couple is just as enamored].
