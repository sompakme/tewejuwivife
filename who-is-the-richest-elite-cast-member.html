The TV series follows the lives of the rich and famous students of Las Encinas where it seems the drama can't stop following them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the show has had <a href=#>a few new faces join the cast</a>, all while some fan faves left for good, it has remained as juicy as it was since season one. With murders, sex, and drugs (and lots of it) taking the reign of most storylines, fans always wonder who the real actors are behind the notorious characters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What The 'Elite' Cast Has To Say bout The Most Scandalous Season Yet</a></span></p><p>While they play some of the most wealthy students on the show, just how rich is the cast in real life, and more so, who, in fact, is the richest Elite cast member? Let's dive in! Or as they'd say on Elite, "Vamos!"</p><h2 id=danna-paola-has-a-10-million-net-worth>Danna Paola Has A $10 Million Net Worth</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danna Paola is certainly a force to be reckoned with. The star played the iconic character, Lucrecia Montesinos Hendrich, also known as "Lu" and we could not imagine anyone else playing the role as well as she did.</p><p>The star was born and raised in Mexican before getting her big break as a child star in both music and acting. Well, when she landed her role on Elite, she was easily one of the biggest names attached to the series.</p><p>Considering her success in the limelight, which includes playing Elphaba at the age of 18, the youngest person to ever play the Wicked role, it's no surprise that she has managed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amass a net worth of $10 million</a>. Mhm. $10 million! Talk about playing a rich character, and being hella rich in real life, amirite?</p><h2 id=what-has-danna-paola-been-up-to-since-leaving-39-elite-39>What Has Danna Paola Been Up To Since Leaving 'Elite'?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being the richest character, Danna left the show following its third season, however, her legacy certainly still lives on.</p><p>The star has focused mainly on her music career, releasing hit singles including 'Oye Pablo', 'Mala Fama, and 'Idiota' to name a few.</p><p>In addition to her stellar singing career, Danna has also become quite the fashionista, attending fashion shows and serving look after look on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her Instagram page.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About 'Elite' Star Danna Paola</a></span></p><h2 id=manu-rios-is-the-true-show-stealer>Manu Rios Is The True Show Stealer</h2><p>Although Danna Paola might be the richest cast member, it seems as if all eyes are on the newest addition to the show, Manu Rios. Manu, who plays Patrick Blanco, has become a fan fave, and we can totally see why!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Spanish heartthrob has managed to become the show stealer, and with his most recent storyline alongside Ivan, played by André Lamoglia, it's no secret that he's not going anywhere anytime soon.</p><p>With his success on the series, the actor has managed to amass a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported net worth of $500,000</a>, and we're certain that's only set to go up from here on out.</p><h2 id=manu-attended-the-met-gala-during-his-first-visit-to-nyc>Manu Attended The Met Gala During His First Visit To NYC</h2><p>The actor has risen to fame so quickly that he even got invited to the 2022 Met Gala. Considering the esteemed event is reserved for A-list stars only, it's evident that Manu has managed to become a pretty big deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Manu graced the Met Gala red carpet wearing head to toe Moschino. During his red carpet interviews, Manu revealed that this was not only his very first Met Gala, but his very first time in New York City. Imagine going to NYC for the first time solely to attend the Met Gala? #Goals!</p><p>"I just need to come back again and have a quiet and calm trip," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Manu told Variety</a> on the red carpet. Luckily, his most recent Instagram posts showcase him living his best life in the Big Apple — so perhaps he is getting that calm and quiet trip after all.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is 'Elite' Actor, Aron Piper And How Much Is He Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMeeZKuhk52ytMCMnqOirJVisKK%2F02aknqWSmr9w</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./woman-on-trial-for-allegedly-trying-to-kill-lookalike-by-poisoning-her-cheesecake-so-she-could-steal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Woman on Trial for Allegedly Trying to Kill Lookalike by Poisoning Her Cheesecake So She Could Steal">&larr;
