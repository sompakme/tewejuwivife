She also has some great friendships with other equally famous people. She often talks about how much she cares about the people who she has let into her life. And she seems like an awesome friend who is always there when others need her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Gomez hasn't released an album since "Rare" in 2020, fans still hope for new <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> at any point. In the meantime, people can't help but pay attention to Selena Gomez's choice to stop following Zayn Malik on Instagram, along with <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a> and Bella Hadid. Is the singer no longer friends with the Hadids?</p><h2 id=why-did-selena-gomez-unfollow-gigi-hadid-bella-hadid-and-zayn-malik-on-instagram>Why Did Selena Gomez Unfollow Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid, And Zayn Malik On Instagram?</h2><p>Selena Gomez is such a smart, kind, and vibrant celebrity, and fans are always invested in her romantic relationships. While she isn't currently seeing anyone, everyone hopes that she finds The One if that's what she wants.</p><p><a href=#>Zayn Malik and Selena Gomez aren't dating</a>, despite the reports that they were seen together a few times. In June 2023, Gomez posted on TikTok and called herself "single!" and "just a little high-maintenance." But in late June 2023, fans noticed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gomez stopped following Malik on Instagram</a>, according to Yahoo!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People reported that Gomez unfollowed Gigi Hadid and Bella Hadid as well. Elle reported that Malik isn't following Gomez anymore, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/did-selena-gomez-really-hook-up-with-zayn-malik-years-ago_-the-mysterious-truth-about-their-relationship-before-their-unproven-dating-rumors.jpg><p>A source explained to People, “There are absolutely no hard feelings with anyone she unfollowed."</p><p>Fans thought that Gomez also removed Dua Lipa from the list of people who she is following. However, she is still following her. But according to Elle, Gomez stopped following Zendaya as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Selena Gomez's Friendship With Meryl Streep Is Unsurprising Given Her Wholesome Reputation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selena Gomez hasn't explained why she decided to stop following these three celebrities. While she has hundreds of millions of followers, she is only following 247 people. Since fans thought that she was good friends with Gigi and Bella Hadid, it's surprising that she would make this decision. Wouldn't she want to follow her close pals?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bella-And-Gigi-Hadid-Donate-All-Fashion-Week-Earnings-to-Ukraine-Relief.jpg><p>Until Gomez shares the reason why she did this, fans will keep guessing. Since the singer has talked about not wanting to be on Instagram much in the past, it's possible that stopped following other people, too. She might have felt that she was following too many accounts and she didn't mean anything by it.</p><p>Of course, since Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid were a serious couple for seven years, fans wondered if Gomez is fighting with Malik and the Hadids. But that doesn't appear to be the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-selena-gomez-still-friends-with-gigi-hadid-and-bella-hadid>Is Selena Gomez Still Friends With Gigi Hadid And Bella Hadid?</h2><p>Selena Gomez was once friends with both Gigi Hadid and Bella Hadid. She has had many celebrity pals in her life. According to J-14, she is very close to Cara Delevingne and Taylor Swift. Gomez has also talked about having four best friends who aren't celebrities.</p><p>There aren't any reports of Gomez no longer being friends with Gigi or Bella Hadid. When people began talking about the possibility of Gomez and Malik dating, a source told Us Weekly, “Gigi has no problem whatsoever with Zayn dating. As long as he is happy and stable and continues to be a good coparent to Khai, she’s fine with whoever he goes out with.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/selena-gomez-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is often speculation that Gomez is fighting with a friend because of her love life. When Gomez and The Weeknd were in a relationship for 10 months, people thought that Bella Hadid was upset because she once dated him, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Think Hailey Bieber Is Sending Cryptic Messages About Selena Gomez As She Begs For The Hateful Comments To Stop</a></span></p><p>Bella Hadid and Gigi Hadid haven't commented on the situation. It's possible that they are still pals with Gomez and they aren't bothered by this at all. The Hadids and Gomez are all super busy running their careers. They might not think that much about social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/every-plastic-surgery-selena-gomez-has-been-accused-of-having-and-whether-or-not-there-s-is-legitimacy-to-the-rumor.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez and two good friends</a> Ashley Cook and Raquelle Stevens were interviewed together. Gomez shared that she really values the relationships in her life.</p><p>According to Elle, Gomez said, “I just needed people in my life that were going to look at me and unconditionally say, ‘Hey, you may not have made the right choice, but we love you, and we don’t think any less of you. We don’t think you’re a bad person. We just care, and this is kind of where you are.’ And that has been the biggest gift of my friendship from you, including Courtney [Lopez], who’s one of our best friends."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/did-selena-gomez-destroy-her-friendship-with-gigi-and-bella-hadid-after-the-zayn-malik-dating-rumors_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gomez continued, "I think it’s a huge part of who I am. I’m just incredibly lucky. And I know, and I want to say this too because this is important, a lot of people don’t get the chance to have friends like we do and I am considered one of the luckiest people in the world because I have three instead of just one. And I get to live life with those people.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Selena Gomez Remains Unbothered Amid The Hailey Bieber Drama</a></span></p><p>Since Gomez cares about friendships, it seems unlikely that she would stop being friends with Bella Hadid and Gigi Hadid because some fans think that she was dating Zayn Malik. It seems like when she decides to be friends with someone, she can tell that they have positive qualities, and she stays loyal to them.</p><p>She has always been friends with other stars, which makes sense since they can relate to each other and the wild world that they live in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/selena-gomez-6.jpg><p>Brooklyn Beckham counts himself among one of Gomez's pals. He said on The Jennifer Hudson Show that he, his wife Nicola Peltz and Gomez have built a friendship. He said "she says we’re a ‘throuple'" and continued, “She’s such a sweet girl, she’s a very sweet girl, obviously very talented. I love when my wife makes new friends, especially really great friends.
