While Dylan and Cole Sprouse had been acting for years, their inclusion on the show significantly heightened their brand recognition. Actresses Ashley Tisdale and Brenda Song became massive stars after the show's debut. Thanks to the show's success, the cast was rewarded rather handsomely through their series paychecks. The Sprouse brothers <a href=#>were once the highest-paid child actor's on television</a>.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-dylan-and-cole-sprouse-make-per-episode><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Much Did Dylan And Cole Sprouse Make Per Episode?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Gawker, Dylan and Cole Sprouse made $20,000 per episode of The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody. Viewers loved the twins, with the show's first episode garnering over 4 million live viewers. Running for three seasons and a total of 87 episodes, the brothers each made over $1.7 million during their stay at the Tipton Hotel. Not too shabby, considering they were 11 when they started filming the show.</p><p>Dylan and Cole don't typically talk about The Suite Life, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dylan did post (and delete) an emotional tribute to the show on its 15th anniversary in 2020</a>. "A lot happened in our lives that was difficult then and this show, in a way, saved us. 1000 years of gratitude to all involved," Dylan said. It's touching to know that the boys treasure the show as much as those who watched and fell in love with it throughout the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-did-brenda-song-make-from-the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Did Brenda Song Make From The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody?</span></h2><p>London Tipton was described as the reason the show was watchable by critics in 2009. Brenda played the sweet but ditzy heiress to a T while on the show. She had acted in minor roles before The Suite Life, but it wasn't until the show's debut that the actress became a sensation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Brenda Song's Recent Projects Almost Make Us Forget She Was A Disney Kid</a></span></p><p>Brenda went on to star in numerous Disney Channel movies, such as Get A Clue and Stuck In The Suburbs. She also starred in the spin-off series The Suite Life On Deck With Zack And Cody, as the character was so popular they couldn't do it without her. According to CelebsFortune.com, Brenda made $2.8 million during the three seasons of The Suite Life Of Zack and Cody.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-did-ashley-tisdale-make-while-on-the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Did Ashley Tisdale Make While On The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody?</span></h2><p>Another breakout star from the show is Ashley Tisdale. Ashley had been acting since she was three years old. She met her then-manager at a New Jersey mall and set out to audition for nearly everything soon after. In 2005, she became a star when she played the smart and sassy Maddie Fitzpatrick.</p><p>According to online sources, Ashley was paid $35,000 per episode. Unlike her cast mates, she didn't continue on to the show's spin-off, as she was too busy with High School Musical and her singing career at that time.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-phill-lewis-make-from-the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Much Did Phill Lewis Make From The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mr. Mosby might be one of the most quotable characters from The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody. Played effortlessly by the hilarious Phill Lewis, the Tipton hotel manager remains a fan-favorite character to this day. Hearing him yell, "no running in my lobby!" <a href=#>is music to a true Disney Channel fan's ears</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Phill Lewis Was Involved In A Horrible Tragedy Before 'The Suite Life'</a></span></p><p>We don't know precisely how much Phill made during his time on The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody. Online sources report <a href=#>the actor having a $1.5 million net worth as of 2022</a>. It makes sense that Phill would be paid less than his counterparts, as his role was smaller. But boy, did his presence on screen always pack a punch.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-kim-rhodes-make-from-the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>How Much Did Kim Rhodes Make From The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Rhodes played Carey Martin, Zack and Cody's mother. Her spiked, blonde pixie cut and determined attitude made her an easy character easy to root for. Plus, she had such a great connection with Dylan and Cole. <a href=#>According to online sources,</a> Carey made around $9,000 per episode of The Suite Life.</p><p>While they aren't in daily contact, she still has a lot of love for her on-screen sons. During an Instagram live session, she told fans she's so proud of the boys and if she were to see them, she "would not have a seconds' hesitation to smush them, pick them up, and burst into tears."</p><h2 id=how-much-did-adrian-r-39-mante-make-per-episode-during-the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>How Much Did Adrian R'Mante Make Per Episode During The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya De la Rosa Ramirez is a name no child of the early 2000s can forget. Adrian R'Mante's portrayal of the lovable and silly bellhop, Esteban, was superb. The actor soon became another fan favorite, with fans still referring to him lovingly as Esteban to this day.</p><p>We don't know how much he made for the performance, but we do know that his current net worth is estimated to be around $400,000. The actor acknowledges the love for his character in his Instagram bio, which says, "Thanks for loving Esteban." <a href=#>While viewers haven't seen him in much</a>, the actor is now happily married with two kids of his own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrqGkmnqttcWeZKieXa%2BupLeMmqWdZZOksbp5wpqqrWWjlrmivthmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-morgan-wallen-going-on-tour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Morgan Wallen going on tour?">&larr;
