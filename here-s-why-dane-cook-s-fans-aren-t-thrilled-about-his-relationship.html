The comic <a href=#>did earn millions with his jokes</a>, but he also earned the ire of people who didn't get his brand of humor. Nowadays, though, Dane is less in the spotlight and more of a homebody.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet fans have learned a whole lot about <a href=#>his private life and all its ups and downs</a>. A big part of his private life (and his Instagram game, let's be honest) is his girlfriend, Kelsi Taylor. The only problem is that even the most ardent Dane Cook fans realize there's something a bit uncomfortable about the couple.</p><p>People who aren't fans also have very specific thoughts about Dane Cook and his girlfriend.</p><h2 id=critics-say-dane-cook-dated-a-teenager>Critics Say Dane Cook Dated A Teenager</h2><p>Dane Cook and his girlfriend Kelsi have been together for four years already, and they show no signs of problems in paradise. However, when news of their relationship first broke, a lot of people were outright disgusted.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Dane Cook's Girlfriend, Kelsi Taylor</a></span></p><p>Scary Mommy even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">penned a piece</a> titled 'Literally Everyone Is Creeped Out That Dane Cook, 46, Is Dating A Teenager.' Need anyone say any more on the subject?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lest anyone think Dane is unfairly being blasted, it's true; Kelsi was 18 when the two began dating. And it turns out she might have been even younger when they first met.</p><h2 id=is-a-27-year-age-gap-too-much>Is A 27-Year Age Gap Too Much?</h2><p>Most people tend to agree that whether someone is famous or not, an age gap isn't the end of the world. Plenty of famous couples (and their non-famous counterparts) have significant age gaps. The concern tends to begin when the younger half of the couple is either still in their teen years or is perceived as being less mature or worldly than their partner.</p><p>And in Kelsi Taylor's case, that's exactly what people presumed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It didn't help that Dane Cook explained that they met at a game night that Dane was hosting. Scary Mommy points out, and rightfully so, that Kelsi was "barely 18" when the two started dating. Which means they likely met before she turned 18.</p><h2 id=did-dane-cook-overstep-a-boundary>Did Dane Cook Overstep A Boundary?</h2><p>Most fans on Twitter (and Scary Mommy's appropriately disgusted journalist) seemed to think that Dane definitely overstepped by inviting an underage teen to his house, then dating her as soon as (or before?) she was barely a legal adult.</p><p>People suggested there was grooming involved, or maybe a weird power dynamic because Dane is famous.</p><p>It's all a bit irksome, but then again, the couple apparently has Kelsi's family's blessing, and the two have been together for years already with no apparent scandals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Why Did Dane Cook's Career Take A Dive In Recent Years?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaVYrCwu8pmnZqmo2LBqb7IpaOenF2dtrR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-melendez-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Melendez Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
