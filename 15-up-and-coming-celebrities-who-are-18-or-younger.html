They are ambitious, adorable, talented and hard working. This is why we at TheRichest wanted to give these young stars a little bit of attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being a teenager is tough in general, with all the peer pressure and self-doubt, it must be so much harder having to go through that while being in the public eye. These young stars have adult jobs and adult responsibilities and not everyone can do it with as much ease as the next fifteen teenagers.</p><p>The following is compiled with 15 celebrities under 18 who are not only killing it right now but are going to continue to kill it in the future. Each of these teenagers has talent, charisma, and potential to do great things in the industry. The world has continuously been impressed with each individual on this list and for those of you who do not know each of these stars, do your research because they are the next generation of Academy Award winners.</p><p>We hope you enjoy this list and more importantly we hope you start following the following starts careers because they are all going to continue to grow in this industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bailee-madison-17><strong>Bailee Madison (17)</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Bailee Madison</a> is a seventeen-year-old actress who has had the opportunity to display her talent on both the big and small screen. Best known for her roles in projects like Just Go With It, the North Pole and The Magic Bracelet.</p><p>Madison is wise beyond her years. Her mature and positive attitude is infectious, something we at TheRichest love about her. In an interview, she was asked to give advice to others who are seeking a career in this business “Never give up. Just follow your dreams because this business can be so hard sometimes. It doesn't happen overnight where you get an audition or even a callback and get the role. It takes time.”</p><p>We love Madison and are ecstatic to see what the future holds for her!</p><h2 id=chandler-riggs-17><strong>Chandler Riggs (17)</strong></h2><p>At only seventeen years old, Chandler Riggs has already made himself recognizable in this industry. Riggs made a name for himself playing Carl Grimes on the hit television show The Walking Dead. The Atlanta Georgia native got this life-changing role at the age of ten and he has been killing it ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Riggs is an incredible actor and his talent is undeniable and although he is a superstar actor, in reality, he is just a normal teenage boy. “I do a lot of video games - I have a YouTube channel where I record me playing video games with my friends and post it. That's a hobby I have and a lot of what I do in my off time” said Riggs in a previous interview.</p><h2 id=aubrey-anderson-emmons-9><strong>Aubrey Anderson-Emmons (9)</strong></h2><p>It is crazy to think that at nine years old, <a href=#>Aubrey Anderson-Emmons</a> has accomplished more with her career than a lot of adults.</p><p>Anderson-Emmons is without a doubt best known as Lily on the epic television series Modern Family. Being on this show has given the actress a tremendous amount of exposure making her known by the masses already.</p><p>Anderson-Emmons as previously mentioned is only nine years old, which is why it is normal that her parents are in control of her finances. When asked how much allowance she gets her answer surprised many “20 dollars a week depending on if I work or not.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We believe that her parents are trying to teach their child the responsibility of money without giving her a lot of it!</p><h2 id=kiernan-shipka-17><strong>Kiernan Shipka (17)</strong></h2><p>Kiernan Shipka is beautiful, talented and only seventeen years of age. Her undisputed star factor has been doing wonders for her acting career. Appearing in projects like Mad Men, Fan Girl and One and Two, this teenager has a bright future ahead of her.</p><p>The Chicago native already has a huge fan base with almost 300,000 followers on Instagram alone. Shipka is by far one of the industries leading teenagers and TheRichest is excited to see what the future holds for her.</p><p>Shipka is also a big fashion enthusiast, so perhaps a fashion line designed by her can be in the works. Shipka claims her style is “constantly changing” stating “I am a huge fashion fan. It's a really cool way to express yourself.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amandla-stenberg-18><strong>Amandla Stenberg (18)</strong></h2><p>Amandla Stenberg is one of the oldest people on this list. The eighteen-year-old actress has been making quite a name for herself in the entertainment industry. Best known for projects like As You Are, The Hunger Games&nbsp;and Colombiana, Stenberg has proven to the world that she has talent.</p><p>For those of you who do not follow this young star on social media, you have probably missed how level headed and mature she is. Stenberg wants her voice to be heard which is something that is so special about her.</p><p>Stenberg stated in an interview “Anyway I say this it’s going to sound pseudo-intellectual or something, but I feel like even though the world feels big and intimidating, it’s almost calming to realize that even within the smallest thing, like a cell, there’s an infinity. And you’d think that wouldn’t be calming, that it would be disconcerting, but actually, it just makes me feel that there’s an organization between everything in the world”, wise words coming from a teenager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=isaac-wright-18><strong>Isaac Wright (18)</strong></h2><p>Another eighteen-year-old that is making moves is Isaac Wright.</p><p>Wright is best known for his role as Bran Stark on the outstanding show Game of Thrones. Anyone who has ever watched the show knows how talented Wright is. Not only does he play his role perfectly, he delivers memorable performances that make the viewers feel, something that is not common.</p><p>When asked about his acting career the young star said the following “It wasn't like I ever said, 'I want to be an actor.' I was in the right place at the right time. I went to a local drama group because I found football on the weekends too cold - which is highly ironic because I've had some of the coldest experiences of my life filming 'Game of Thrones.”</p><p>Wright has an incredible gift and his future is incredibly bright. We at TheRichest can't wait to see what is next for him.</p><h2 id=noah-cyrus-17><strong>Noah Cyrus (17)</strong></h2><p>Noah Cyrus is little sister to <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>. Similar to Miley, Noah Cyrus has a pretty killer voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The seventeen-year-old Nashville native has been killing it in the studio and on stage. Cyrus, who clearly got some pointers from superstar sister has a lot of talent and potential. Her song “Make You Cry” became a huge success proving to the world that she is just as talented as her big sister.</p><p>Noah Cyrus recently performed at Coachella and she is said to have stolen the show. It was her first time performing at the famous festival and her fans were grateful that she did.</p><p>Noah Cyrus has a huge career ahead of her and we are excited to see what she will come out with next.</p><h2 id=willow-shields-16><strong>Willow Shields (16)</strong></h2><p>Willow Shields is a sixteen-year-old actress who is making quite a splash in the industry. Best known for her role in The Hunger Games, Shields is a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Willow Shields is a teenager who is in the public eye, something that is sometimes difficult to handle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked if her life had changed since becoming more popular she said the following “Well, my life hasn't really changed... I've been homeschooled for a long time. So that helped a lot because of shooting and stuff. But, I have had friends who I've been friends with for years and years and they are my true. friends, you know?”</p><p>This young actress is a very disciplined and hard worker who pushed herself to be the best version of her she can possibly be.</p><h2 id=rowan-blanchard-15><strong>Rowan Blanchard (15)</strong></h2><p>Rowan Blanchard may only be fifteen but her attitude, maturity, and talent make her wise beyond her years.</p><p>The Girl Meets World star is very passionate about gender equality and her age does not stop her from expressing what she believes to be right and wrong. "I'm happy to talk about what I'm wearing. It's cool to spotlight a new designer on the runway and to contribute to the fashion world that I love. It's a very special thing I get to do, but don't make my story, and who I am, be my dress, while my male co-star's story is how he picks scripts and gets inspired. Why not ask me that, too? Ask me work questions, too! Ask me about my life”, stated the actress during an interview with Elle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The world needs more young women like Blanchard to help guide this up and coming generation. We at TheRichest love Rowan Blanchard and we think she is one of the best role models for young girls around the world.</p><h2 id=finn-wolfhard-14><strong>Finn Wolfhard (14)</strong></h2><p>Finn Wolfhard is one of the coolest kids on the planet because he is one of the stars of the coolest show, Stranger Things.</p><p>Wolfhard is a fourteen-year-old actor whose talent is beyond amazing. This young star is hard working, disciplined and super adorable. Wolfhard is adjusting to his new, quick rise to fame “I got out of the car and I just heard men – like, full-grown men – screaming, ‘Finn, Finn, Finn!’”</p><p>The Canadian native is very well spoken and when asked about how he got into acting in a previous interview he stated “I just used to be interested in filmmaking in general, think growing up in Vancouver is a different lifestyle than growing up in most other places. People make different choices, obviously. Finally, I just got into acting. I got my first gig on Craigslist.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For anyone who has not watched Stranger Things, you should check it out as it does not disappoint.</p><h2 id=nell-tiger-free-17><strong>Nell Tiger Free (17)</strong></h2><p>Nell Tiger Free is a seventeen-year-old knockout and what many would call “jail bait”. The actress who made a name for herself in the television series Game of Thrones is definitely a talented girl to keep your eye out for.</p><p>Free is one of those people who you look at and you just know she is going to be doing great things in the future. Her natural beauty in combination with her undeniable talent is just two of the reasons why she has such a big fanbase.</p><p>This teenager has that “it” factor and the people behind Game of Thrones saw that instantly. We at TheRichest love the show and we love to see this young talent on our small screens!</p><h2 id=mackenzie-foy-16><strong>Mackenzie Foy (16)</strong></h2><p>Mackenzie Foy is sixteen years old, however, she is truly wise beyond her years. Foy as a certain “je ne sais quoi” about her that draws anyone who is watching her in. Her undeniable beauty, raw talent, and simple style are what makes this teenager stand out from the competition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Foy is best known for her roles in films like Interstellar and Twilight. Currently, she is working on The Nut Cracker and The Four Realms, which should be out in 2018.</p><p>Foy has everything going for her and we know she has a lot to look forward to in the future “I want to act for the rest of my life - and I also want to pursue directing. Watching Bill Condon direct 'Twilight' kind of made me think, 'OK yeah, I really want to do this now.' This idea that you can make an image in your head and be in full control of how it comes out - I thought that was really cool” said Foy in a previous interview.</p><h2 id=camren-bicondova-17><strong>Camren Bicondova (17)</strong></h2><p>Camren Bicondova is a seventeen-year-old actress who is one of the most talented teenagers on the planet. Most of you probably recognize her from the hit television series Gotham, where she plays a young Catwoman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bicondova, who was born in San Diego but grew up is Hawaii is currently living in New York City. The student actress is looking forward to finishing high school, yes that is right, she goes to school and is a full-time actress at the same time. Bicondova is determined and motivated, something that is most likely linked to her being a military brat.</p><p>Bicondova is super talented and works hard to stay focused “I personally like to talk to people when I'm not doing a scene, still acting as if I'm in Gotham when I'm on set because I don't really like to break character since I sometimes get distracted. I may get distracted when I'm talking to people and having fun; then I have to check myself.”</p><h2 id=millie-bobby-brown-13><strong>Millie Bobby Brown (13)</strong></h2><p>While watching the first season of Stranger Things I think every viewer was thinking “damn that girl is talented!” Millie Bobby Brown is a thirteen-year-old sensation who took the world by storm this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brown is not only adorable but she is fiercely talented. For those who have not yet seen the show, she plays the mysterious Eleven and her acting chops will prove to you why everyone is talking about her. When asked about her character, the actress said the following “Eleven is strong. She’s very vulnerable, but she can be very, very badass”, and we could not agree more.</p><p>We at TheRichest can't wait for season 2 to come out and we are so excited to see what happens next for both Eleven and Millie Bobby Brown.</p><h2 id=lily-rose-depp-17><strong>Lily Rose Depp (17)</strong></h2><p>When your dad is <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a>, you are bound to have some talent when it comes to acting. Lily-Rose Depp is to us, the hottest celeb under 18 for so many reasons.</p><p>The Paris native who is only 17 years old is undeniably beautiful, she is the perfect mix of both her father and her mother Vanessa Paradis, the supermodel.</p><p>Depp is a real talent, she has appeared in plenty of projects such as The Dancer, Yoga Hosers, and our personal favorite Planetarium.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp lives and breaths acting and take her job very seriously “I can act every single day because I love it; it's just so liberating. It might be rare, but there are certain moments when you really don't feel like yourself. When you are in the character so fully, it's the best feeling ever. I so love it. Even if those moments come just once a day or every other day, they are just worth it” stated Depp.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWauqF2Wu6V5wqikoqaXYrCmuMSbqaKsmZrAbsHNnZyrZWFtfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ed-rollins-fox-news-bio-age-wife-family-education-daughter-political-analysis-book-and-net-wo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ed Rollins Fox News Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Education, Daughter, Political Analysis, Book and Net wo">&larr;
