In 2018, he signed a four-year deal with Starz Network which came as an investment in his drama series, 'Power'. The deal consists of a three-series commitment which could prove to be worth up to $150 million. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Power has proved to be a hit series with an average of 7.3 million viewers</a> and even won three 2018 NAACP Image Awards in addition to being the most watched Starz Network series in history.</p><p>As successful as the series has been, 50 Cent was only paid $17,000 per episode to wear the hats of actor, executive producer, and music creator for the series, according to HipHopDX. There are an estimated 10 episodes per season, which means he's making at least $170,000. Between June 2014 and February 2020, the show aired 63 episodes in total, which means that it made $1.07 million in total.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-did-50-cent-make-from-his-shares-in-effen-vodka><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Did 50 Cent Make From His Shares In Effen Vodka?</span></h2><h3 id=effen-vodka-returned-investment-60-million>Effen Vodka Returned Investment: $60 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-64.png><p>Skillful as he is as a businessman, 50 Cent has proven to be strategic in his investments. In 2014, he partnered with the Holland-based vodka brand, Effen Vodka, and bought a minority stake in the company. Although the 'Candy Shop' rapper admittedly doesn't drink alcohol, smoke, or do other drugs, he capitalized on the needs of those who do, especially in the music industry.

Besides his appearance in the TV series Power and Power Book II: Ghost, he has also recently been in a few newer movies, many of them with A-list actor Sylvester Stallone. Earlier this year, on September 22, <a href=#>Jackson was featured in The Expendables 4</a>, the fourth installment in The Expendables film series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' movie became a cult classic and showcased his acting potential, setting him up for future acting opportunities. At the time, the multi-million-dollar success of his music and other ventures allowed him to speak with movie producer Avi Lerner, who shared business ideas with Jackson. This inspired him to develop his own film production company, called Cheetah Vision, which he co-founded in 2009 with Randall Emmett.</p><p>50 Cent was then able to land a $200 million deal for the company, which would fund and release 10 films to be distributed by Gindstone/Lionsgate. Each of the films would have a budget of $20 million each, and Jackson was able to pay himself $10 million for his role in them.</p><p><strong>These are some of 50 Cent's most notable films of his acting career:</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=6 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Film/Year of Release</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Notable Actors</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Box office sales</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2005)</p></td><td><p>Terrance Howard, Joy Bryant, Bill Duke, Ashley Walters</p></td><td><p>$46.4 million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Home of the Brave (2006)</p></td><td><p>Samuel L.

The estate, which previously belonged to Mike Tyson, was purchased for $4.1 million, plus Jackson spent an additional $6 million on upgrades such as a private movie theater and a helicopter pad. But the home soon proved to be too much to maintain, and by 2007, he was eager to sell it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, 50 Cent did not find immediate success in selling the property.
