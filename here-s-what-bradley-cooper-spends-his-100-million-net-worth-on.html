Luckily, I didn’t listen.” “I loved that it was really, really hard to make this film. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have the same value. And that’s always been my goal: to make something, no matter how challenging, that will be remembered.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Cooper discussed with ET Canada, what others have to say usually doesn’t faze him. Cooper also recalls being told that he wasn’t good looking enough to make it in the industry… clearly, that all changed during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hangover</a> and throughout his career. He took a big risk with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Star Is Born</a>, one that once again paid off big time alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga</a>. That leads to the question, what is Cooper spending his massive net worth on. From the cars, bikes, New York Home, and everything in-between, we’ll highlight where he spends a huge chunk of his cash.</p><p>Enjoy folks and be sure to share the article with a friend!</p><h2 id=13-5-million-townhouse-in-new-york><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>$13.5 Million Townhouse In New York</span></h2><p>It is a prime location out in Manhattan. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooper dropped quite the penny</a> on his stunning home, valued at over $13 million. According to E Online, the stunning townhouse is located in a beautiful area and the home on the inside is of course completely redone and modernized;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The simple yet sophisticated West Village townhouse in New York City is a stunner with approximately 4,000 square feet and a classic red-brick exterior. The 43-year-old's new home boasts six bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms with all of the luxurious amenities and smart-house fixtures you could want.”</p><h2 id=expensive-cars-in-the-garage><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Expensive Cars In The Garage</span></h2><p>Cooper has a luxury garage and it doesn’t surprise us one bit, given his massive net worth. He loves to ride in big SUV cars, most notably he’s seen riding out in LA in a massive Mercedes G-Wagon, a car most of us can only dream of owning.</p><p>Depending on the model, the ride ranges in the six-figure range, which is more than affordable for one of the highest-paid actors of the current generation.</p><h2 id=and-motorbikes><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>And Motorbikes</span></h2><p>Cooper has an even more diverse collection when it comes to his motorbikes. Once again out in LA, he’s typically spotted riding different bikes. We’ve seen Cooper with a modern KTM bike, which has an orange theme to it – though some might argue that his go-to ride is the stunning Ducati speed bike, which is preferred by most.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who can forget the moment of Cooper riding off in style with his bike following a lunch alongside Lady Gaga.</p><h2 id=the-30-000-watch><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The $30,000 Watch</span></h2><p>He was spotted rocking the dad look, wearing shorts, a dad hat, and a varsity sweatshirt. The one standout from the outfit, however, his watch valued at over $30,000, the IWC Big Pilot’s Watch Limited Edition IW501007.</p><p>Cooper rocked the same watch during red carpet ceremonies, which went with his outfit. However, on this day, it was completely noticeable – to his credit, he rocked it nonetheless!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Tyson And Bradley Cooper: The Truth About Their Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=a-list-vacations><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>A-List Vacations</span></h2><p>As they say, work hard, play hard. That’s the case for Cooper during his downtime when he finally takes a vacation. Observer compared to one of his recent trips to the former President’s Barack Obama – the two took a similar <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trip to Tahiti on a private yacht. </a>Cooper took the trip alongside his then-wife, Irina Shayk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The trip was all about luxury, as the former couple was joined by some wealthy fashion designers.</p><h2 id=luxury-meals><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Luxury Meals</span></h2><p>“You know what? I think it would be Benny the Bum’s. It’s a seafood restaurant in the northeast.”</p><p>Those were Cooper’s words with Variety, discussing his favorite restaurant. Let’s put his cooking film aside, as it wasn’t the most well-received of his career, nonetheless the actor is a big foodie that loves to indulge. Turn out, Cooper is “amazingly nice” as well when he’s out at the restaurant. According to an Osteria 166 employee, Cooper was a class act and he even thanked the chef for the great food.</p><h2 id=private-jet-accommodations><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Private Jet Accommodations</span></h2><p>It only makes sense that Cooper uses a private jet when it comes to his commute from LA to New York. He’d cause quite the commotion at a commercial airport given his obvious star power.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He rode with a private SUV, who brought him to the private plane alongside his daughter, according to Daily Mail. Since the separation with his ex-wife, Cooper is still trying to make things work, playing an active role in his daughter’s life – even if it means long travel time.</p><h2 id=a-star-is-born-investment><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>A Star Is Born Investment</span></h2><p>Although Cooper ended up making quite the penny due to the success of the film – it wasn’t an easy one to create. Cooper sank a lot of time and effort into the project – he discussed all the hurdles involved in making the film with&nbsp;Screen Daily;</p><p>“It was a long process to get that coupling greenlit by Warner Bros but in retrospect I’m glad it wasn’t easy,” he says. “No part of this movie was easy. First of all, it’s a guy who’s never made a movie making a fourth version of A Star Is Born and a singer who’s never made a film.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Throwback Pics Of Lady Gaga And Bradley Cooper Too Good To Ignore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-little-things-like-the-rest-of-us><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Little Things Like The Rest Of Us</span></h2><p>Like the rest of us, whether it be in LA or New York, Cooper is out and about, doing the common things like buying groceries. What isn’t a shock is the fact that he’s typically spotted by the paparazzi. The media would make a huge deal when he was out shopping for groceries alongside Lady Gaga, though she was quick to point out that their relationship was nothing but professional with Elle;</p><p>“Quite frankly, I think the press is very silly,” the 33-year-old said. “I mean, we made a love story. For me, as a performer and as an actress, of course, we wanted people to believe that we were in love.”</p><h2 id=charity-work><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Charity Work</span></h2><p>Cooper has taken part in lots of charitable causes throughout the year. He teamed up alongside the IWC, according to Forbes, the two sides helped in generating funds for the youth in need;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Supporting disabled children and adolescents is one of the cornerstones of our CSR (corporate social responsibility) effort. I am pleased that, together with our brand ambassador Bradley Cooper, and the Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Youth Foundation, we have the opportunity to support the association Arrimage.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria Beckham Flaunts T-Shirts Featuring George Michael’s Iconic Album for LGBTQ Charity</a></span></p><h2 id=clothes-for-the-homeless><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Clothes For The Homeless</span></h2><p>According to Perez Hilton, Cooper dropped thousands, aiding the homeless out in Philly, hooking them up with suitable winter clothing;</p><p>“The actor sent his assistant to buy coats, gloves, scarves and hats for the less fortunate as fall is inching closer toward what will most likely be a harsh winter (considering the east coast got a snowstorm on Halloween). According to sources, Cooper was at one point in such a charitable mood that he gave a homeless man the jacket he was wearing on the spot after receiving a compliment for it!” What a gesture!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT –<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What Dwayne Johnson Spends His $280 Million Net Worth On</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources – Forbes, Perez Hilton, Elle, People & Daily Mail</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZJuqkZm5psWMnKaoqJWnerS8xKebrGWYnsBufY9pZKahnKG2sLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jKilaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-aniston-ivf-to-become-mom-on-own.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Aniston IVF To Become Mom On Own">&larr;
