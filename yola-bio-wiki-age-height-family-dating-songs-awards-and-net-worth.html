The counterpoints of these genres would go on to formulate her vocal style that is both hard and soft, smooth and raspy. It would prove to be difficult to find where she could fit in with this range of sound in her voice.</p><p>Yola spent time in her early career as a frontwoman for hire and feature vocalist, for DJ/producers such as Bugz in the Attic,&nbsp;Duke Dumont,&nbsp;Massive Attack,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sub Focus.</p><p>Amongst other projects, she also worked at the production company Replay Heaven as a vocalist, writer, and arranger in London.</p><p>Upon moving back to her hometown of Bristol, England, she started spending time making music with some local musicians that formed a band called Phantom Limb.</p><p>This project ran concurrently with her time in Bugz In The Attic, Massive Attack, and numerous other acts. The band disbanded in December 2012, completing two studio albums across 8 years.</p><p>Following this was a hiatus from performing after her mother died on 30 September 2013. This hiatus gave rise to Yola’s solo career, as she emerged playing the guitar, and with songs that spoke to her life and sense of isolation as a black woman in music in the UK. During this hiatus, she also co-wrote a top 10 song with DJ/producer Sub Focus, and delivered the lead vocal on the International top 5 hits “Won’t Look Back”.</p><p>Yola released her first solo EP,&nbsp;<i>Orphan Offering</i>, in 2016. In February 2019, she released her debut album&nbsp;<i>Walk Through Fire</i>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Dan Auerbach’s Easy Eye Sound label, to much acclaim.</p><p>The album title references a fire that damaged Yola’s home and she escaped.&nbsp;AllMusic called the album “an extraordinary record, one designed to be part of a grand musical tradition, and it contains enough emotion and imagination to earn its place within that lineage.”&nbsp;Brittney McKenna of&nbsp;NPR Music’s First Listen declared, “It’s the work of an artist sure to stun audiences for years to come.”&nbsp;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>&nbsp;stated, “The album is an introduction to a seasoned, major vocalist that stands to be remembered as a breakthrough.”</p><p><i>Walk Through Fire</i> was written, recorded, and produced at&nbsp;Dan Auerbach’s Easy Eye Studio in Nashville. Auerbach produced the record and assembled an all-star cast for its creation.</p><p>Most of the songwriting was a collaboration of Yola and Auerbach with contributions from Bobby Wood,&nbsp;Pat McLaughlin,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dan Penn. The team of studio musicians included bassist Dave Roe, harmonica player Charlie McCoy along with former members of the Memphis Boys drummer Gene Crisman and Wood on piano. Additional vocals were contributed by&nbsp;Vince Gill,&nbsp;Molly Tuttle,&nbsp;Ronnie McCoury,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stuart Duncan.</p><p>The album was recorded and engineered by M. Allen Parker. Auerbach and Parker also mixed the project.&nbsp;In March 2019, Yola made her American television debut on&nbsp;<i>CBS This Morning’</i>s Saturday Sessions segment, where she played selections from&nbsp;<i>Walk Through Fire.</i></p><p>She, alongside&nbsp;Sheryl Crow, contributed to two tracks on the&nbsp;debut album&nbsp;by&nbsp;The High women.</p><p>Yola made a splash at the&nbsp;Newport Folk Festival&nbsp;2019 with&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone</i>&nbsp;proclaiming, “Yola became the single most sought-after voice at this year’s festival. She played a triumphant side-stage show, served as an unofficial member of&nbsp;The Highwaymen, and added her own vocals to performances by everyone from&nbsp;Dolly Parton&nbsp;to&nbsp;Dawes, who let the fast-rising singer take over for the entirety of their 2009 song “When You Call My Name.”</p><p>According to Glide Magazine, “People came from far and wide to hear Yola sing, either because they were enchanted by her excellent release from earlier this year <i>Walk Through Fire</i>, or because word of mouth had reached them that this was not to be missed.”</p><p><i>Walk Through Fire</i>&nbsp;generated three Grammy Award nominations. The album was nominated for&nbsp;Best Americana Album&nbsp;and the track “Faraway Look” was nominated for&nbsp;Best American Roots Song&nbsp;and&nbsp;Best American Roots Performance. Additionally, Yola was nominated for&nbsp;Best New Artist.</p><p>On 21 February 2020, Variety announced that she has been cast to play the role of singer Sister&nbsp;Rosetta Tharpe&nbsp;— dubbed the Godmother of rock and roll — in Australian director&nbsp;Baz Luhrmann’s still-untitled drama on the life of Elvis Presley.</p><p>In December 2020, she was featured in&nbsp;Ringo Starr’s single and video “Here’s To The Nights”, from his 2021&nbsp;<i>Zoom In</i>&nbsp;EP.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=yolanda-quartey-songs></span><span>Yolanda Quartey Songs</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=studio-albums></span><span>Studio albums</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=solo></span>Solo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><i>Orphan Offering EP</i>&nbsp;(2016)</li><li><i>Walk Through Fire</i>&nbsp;(2019)</li><li><i>Stand for Myself</i>&nbsp;(2021)</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=singles></span><span>Singles</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4><span>As lead artist</span></h4><p>“I Don’t Wanna Lie” (2019)</p><p>“Hold On” (2020)</p><h4><span>As featured artist</span></h4><p>“Stop Crying Your Heart Out” (as BBC Radio 2’s Allstars) (2020)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=yolanda-quartey-awards-and-achievements></span><span><span>Yolanda Quartey</span><span> Awards and Achievements</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>2017 UK Americana Awards</li><li>2019 Americana Music Honors & Awards</li><li>2020 62nd Grammy Awards<br>UK Americana Awards</li></ul><h1><span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Yolanda Quartey</span></span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-yolanda-quartey></span><span><span>Who is Yolanda Quartey?</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is an English musician, singer, and songwriter, who received four nominations at the 62nd Grammy Awards, including the all-genre Best New Artist category.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-yolanda-quartey></span><span><span>How old is Yolanda Quartey?&nbsp;</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yola is an American national born on 31 July 1983, in Bristol, England.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-yolanda-quartey></span><span><span>How tall is Yolanda Quartey?</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yola stands at an average height, she has not shared her height with the public.
