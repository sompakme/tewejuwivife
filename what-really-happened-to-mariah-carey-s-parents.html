Despite that, the truth of the matter is that there are a lot of things in life that being a wealthy celebrity can’t fix. For example, when a family bond is truly broken, it can’t be mended by anything that money can buy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Mariah Carey Close To Her Sister, Allison Carey?</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for Mariah Carey, she is an example of a celebrity whose family is broken despite everything that she has accomplished. After all, the press has covered <a href=#>the rift that exists between Mariah and her estranged sister Alison</a>. If that wasn’t bad enough, even though most of <a href=#>Mariah’s fans now understand why Mariah hasn’t helped out her homeless sister</a>, a lot of people were angry at the singer in the past. Given everything that is known about Mariah and her sister, that begs an obvious question, what kind of relationship does the singer have with her parents?</p><h2 id=mariah-carey-had-a-complicated-relationship-with-her-father>Mariah Carey Had A Complicated Relationship With Her Father</h2><p>When Mariah Carey was only three-years-old, her parents Alfred and Patricia got divorced. Brought up by her mother, Mariah has revealed that she never spent a lot of time with her dad aside from going to church together and she looked forward to those times all week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Mariah Carey's Secret Recordings</a></span></p><p>As an adult, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah continued to have a complicated relationship with her dad</a> even as she took the music world by storm, With that in mind, it makes sense that Mariah reached out to <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> after learning about her father drama. Sadly, Mariah Carey learned that her father had been diagnosed with cancer in the early 2000s and the prognosis wasn’t good.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mariah Carey Praised For Revealing She Reached Out To Britney Spears During Her Conservatorship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her memoir “The Meaning of Mariah Carey”, Mariah expressed her feelings on the fact that her father developed bile-duct cancer in specific. “A healthy man develops a cancer that poisons the part of his body that absorbs and washes away waste. My father held so much inside and had little opportunity to flush out all the bitterness he’d consumed.”</p><p>When Mariah Carey writes or speaks about her father, her mixed feelings typically are obvious. While that may confuse some, the dual way Mariah talks about her dad actually makes a lot of sense. After all, she clearly had a strained relationship with her father but Mariah has revealed she made up with him before his passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was clear there was nothing to be done to stop the toxic disease wreaking havoc in his body. It was almost his time. We knew our time together on this earth was limited, so my father and I got down to the business of talking things through. His sickness made our healing urgent. This was the first time I revealed to him (or any family member) my struggles growing up.” Once her dad passed away, Mariah discovered that he’d collected magazine and news clippings about her. Mariah then went to great effort to plan a beautiful funeral service for her dad which she recreated for her “Through the Rain” music video as a tribute to him.</p><h2 id=mariah-carey-and-her-mom-had-a-role-reversal>Mariah Carey And Her Mom Had A Role Reversal</h2><p>When Mariah Carey has talked about the origins of her singing career, she has credited her mother by saying she learned vocal skills by imitating her mom’s opera music. On top of that, Mariah has made it clear that she appreciates that her mom worked several jobs to try to provide for her children. However, that doesn’t mean that Mariah has a traditional relationship with her mom, whatever that means.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For proof of how unique Mariah Carey’s relationship with her mom is, all you have to do is read the dedication that was included in the singer’s memoir “The Meaning of Mariah Carey”. ″And to Pat, my mother, who, through it all, I do believe actually did the best she could. I will love you the best I can, always.″ In the pages of her memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah summed up her past relationship with her mom succinctly</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>″I loved her deeply, and, like most kids, I wanted her to be a safe place for me. Above all, I desperately wanted to believe her. But ours is a story of betrayal and beauty. Of love and abandonment. Of sacrifice and survival.” ″It has caused me so much pain and confusion. Time has shown me there is no benefit in trying to protect people who never tried to protect me. Time and motherhood have finally given me the courage to honestly face who my mother has been to me."</p><p>Throughout her aforementioned memoir, Mariah Carey’s empathy for her mother often is on full display. After all, Mariah gives multiple possible explanations for her mom’s often hurtful conduct. For example, Mariah reveals that her grandmother was a harsh person who disowned her mom for marrying and having kids with a black man. On top of that, Mariah writes that her mom, a vocal coach and singer, seemed to see her daughter’s singing skills as competition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After offering empathy to her mother in her memoir, Mariah also wrote about her mom always coming to her for money while not showing “genuine, sustained interest″ in her daughter’s life. Feeling like providing for her mom caused a role reversal in their relationship, Carey revealed in her memoir that she now calls her mom Pat on her therapist's advice. Finally, Mariah described her current feelings on her mom. ″It has taken me a lifetime to find the courage to confront the stark duality of my mother, the beauty and the beast that coexist in one person — and to discover there's beauty in all of us.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Mariah Carey Reveals How Her Difficult Childhood Made Christmas Day Hard</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWStp12irrO1wKFknJmimsa0ec%2BaqZ6mpKh8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./yasmeen-nicole-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yasmeen Nicole Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
