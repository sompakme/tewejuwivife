The stage name itself is funny, but the true talent comes from Thompson's masterfully craft at adding props to his standup comedy gigs. On television, he was just everywhere. If you were a kid in the mid-to-late '90s, you might have even recognized his voice as the Cartoon Network announcer, presenting diversity in his career for kids and adults. During his stint at Cartoon Network, he also produced and starred in an early morning show called Carrot Top's AM Mayhem. Besides comedy, Thompson has shown himself in being a hilarious actor, appearing in an amount of TV shows and movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If there is one show that he should absolutely make an appearance in, it would have to be <a href=#>Whose Line Is It Anyway?</a> as the show has a game called "Props," and it would be a missed opportunity if he doesn't appear at least once. He has been referenced, but being a guest star would make audiences laugh as hard when Richard Simmons appeared. That wish aside, what is there to know about Carrot Top and his legacy as a comedian? Here's what you need to know about the redheaded comedic genius.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Comedian, Dane Cook Up To Today?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-carrot-top>What Happened To Carrot Top?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From a local swimming coach, Thompson obtained the nickname "Carrot Top," as a reference to his fiery, bright red hair. Unsurprisingly, his red hair would become a trademark for his career while earning a unique stage name. It wasn't just his red hair that made him stood out, but his comedic strategy of using props has gifted him another nickname, "The King of Prop." Thompson was first a student at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida when he ventured into comedy. In his first year, he went to a comedy club and saw live standup for the first time. His roommate eventually convinced him to sign up at an open mic night. Through trial and error, Thompson's career began after falling in love with doing standup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his about section from his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a>, the trademark red locks and undeniably inventive use of props have vaulted the Floridian native to the level that most comedians can only hope to reach “Nobody can steal my act.” He constantly channels his creative genius to invent new props and the results end on a high note. Thompson was a guest in many talk shows, most notably in The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He made an astounding amount of appearances with <a href=#>Jay Leno</a> 31 times, even making his return in the last episode as an honor. His other appearances include his 1991 television debut in Comic Strip Live, Late Night With Conan O’Brien, and The Late, Late Show with Craig Ferguson.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Comedian Wasn't Afraid To Constantly Rip On Jerry Seinfeld</a></span></p><h2 id=carrot-top-was-also-a-talented-actor>Carrot Top Was Also A Talented Actor</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carrot Top is just too iconic to play as a different person in TV shows and movies. While there are a few credits where he did play as a character, his lineup consists of portraying himself. He appeared in comedy shows such as Family Guy, <a href=#>George Lopez</a>, Robot Chicken, and even in CSI: Criminal Scene Investigation. His most recent credit is for 2021's Bar Rescue, a reality TV show focusing on Jon Taffer saving failing bars from closing doors.</p><p>Thompson's notable appearances in movies happen to be The Hangover, where he is only seen in the end credits scene, and Sharknado: The 4th Awakens, making a cameo as a driver. His other film credits include Chairman of the Board, Dennis the Menace Strikes Again, and Swearnet: The Movie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Howard Stern Never Became A Stand-Up Comic</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-carrot-top-doing-today>What Is Carrot Top Doing Today?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to his website, Thompson has been doing his Las Vegas headlining residency at Luxor Hotel and Casino ever since 2005. Sin City has been his home for about 17 years and continues to provide laughter to fans and audiences that attend his shows. He has also appeared in a handful of podcasts, including one with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Rogan</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Van Vliet</a>. Comments made about the comedian have been nothing but positive and wholesome, as fans who got to meet him sang praises about him.</p><p>He might not have a big <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">social media following</a> compared to other comedians, but he has a respectable amount of dedicated fans who enjoy his talent and humor. His legacy shouldn't be ignored as he stands out with unique trademarks and his method in approaching comedy. If you happen to be in Las Vegas, you can do a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meet and greet</a> with him. He also has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tour dates</a> happening in May in the following states: Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and Michigan. At relatively cheap prices compared to other showings and meet and greets, Carrot Top is looking to be well worth every dollar if you want to see his show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>These 8 Celebrities Started Out As Stand-Up Comedians</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq%2FAq6morF2pvLF5kWlpa2c%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-the-voice-of-jay-bilzerian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is the voice of Jay Bilzerian?">&larr;
