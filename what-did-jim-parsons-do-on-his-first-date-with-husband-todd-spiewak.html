Spiewak, who was working in advertising as a graphic designer at the time, has said the connection between him and Parsons "was pretty quick." It sure sounds so: Spiewak's song choice that night was Cher's "I Found Someone."</p><p>Having met while just starting out in the filming industry, the couple dated for a long time before finally revealing their relationship to the world. In August 2010, after being nominated for lead actor in a comedy series the previous year, Parsons takes home his first win at the Emmys for playing Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory. Toward the end of his acceptance speech, he says "And most of all, I love you, Mom," followed by a list of names, including Todd Spiewak. The mention goes unnoticed by most viewers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jim for the most part has kept his relationship secluded from the public and in rightfully doing so, he was able to endure the maximum benefits of his relationship whilst keeping the world out.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Jim Parsons Refused To Wear Revealing Star Wars Attire During Season 5 Of The Big Bang Theory">Jim Parsons Refused To Wear Revealing Star Wars Attire During Season 5 Of The Big Bang Theory</a></span></p><h2 id=what-did-jim-and-todd-do-for-their-first-date>What Did Jim And Todd Do For Their First Date?</h2><p>Jim Parsons and his husband Todd Spiewak have been together for 20 years!</p><p>The Big Bang Theory alumnus and the producer tied the knot in May 2017, more than a decade after they were introduced by friends in November 2002.</p><p>“My life changed completely and completely for the better,” the Hollywood actor reminisced via Instagram in November 2020 about their first date — a night out on the town in New York City that included singing karaoke and playing pool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Parsons has been candid about his complete adoration of Spiewak — who has produced several of the actor’s shows, including Young Sheldon and Call Me Kat — throughout the years.</p><p>“When we first got together, I remember lying in bed and closing my eyes but not being asleep. And that sensation of ‘light,’” Parsons recalled in an interview in September 2017. “I was like, ‘I don’t know what’s going on exactly, but it’s sort of close to eternal.’”</p><p>Parsons has said that, "I would never consider my relationship with Todd an act of activism, rather simply an act of love."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Did Jim Parsons Really Do Ballet To Memorize His Lines For Sheldon In 'Big Bang Theory'?">Did Jim Parsons Really Do Ballet To Memorize His Lines For Sheldon In 'Big Bang Theory'?</a></span></p><h2 id=jim-and-todd-waited-years-before-they-decided-to-tie-the-knot>Jim And Todd Waited Years Before They Decided To Tie The Knot</h2><p>Jim Parsons and his husband Todd Spiewak were together for nearly 15 years before they decided to finally tie the knot earlier this year — and according to the Big Bang Theory actor, it was well worth the wait.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The four-time Emmy winning actor explained why they waited so long to get married. “We just didn’t care about the act of it that much, to be honest with you,” said Parsons, 44. “That sounds cold in a way, but I finally thought: ‘Well, let’s have a party then for the celebration, and we’ll go ahead and legalize this thing.’ ”</p><p>The trip down the aisle ended up being much more special than he had anticipated.</p><p>“It was so much more meaningful in the moment for me than I predicted, and it’s been resonantly much more meaningful than for me afterward than I ever saw coming,” he said. “You know, I had been an adult gay person for so long at a time where that wasn’t possible where life was ‘fine’ for me.”</p><p>Parsons and Spiewak, a graphic designer, said their “I dos” in May at the Rainbow Room in New York City.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was fantastic … much more fun than I thought it would be,” he told Extra days later at the CBS upfront presentation. “I wasn’t too nervous, [it was] just a lot to organize and I thought, ‘Well, this will be sort of fun … Let’s get through this,’ then it was all fun.”</p><p>“It was the latest I stayed up in many years,” he added. “I’ll be honest with you — I’m still paying for it.
