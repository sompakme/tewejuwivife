In truth, we're seeing some of her best work come to life on the TV screen, as she continues to thrive on '<a href=#>The Morning Show</a>' alongside Reese Witherspoon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Will 'The Morning Show' End After Season 2?</a></span></p><p>Not only is the show receiving great reviews, but she's also getting a lot richer on the show. We'll take a look at how her salary compares to another iconic series she worked on in the past, '<strong><a href=#>Friends'</a></strong><strong><a href=#>.</a></strong> In addition, we'll take a look at how much the icon is worth today. In truth, she's inching towards that billionaire status.</p><h2 id=she-39-s-still-making-a-fortune-off-39-friends-39>She's Still Making A Fortune Off 'Friends'</h2><p>Of course, Aniston's career changed completely when she joined the cast of 'Friends', taking on the role of Rachel Green. Unlike 'The Morning Show', she didn't start with a wage in the seven figures, in fact during season one, she made just over $22,000 per episode.</p><p>It was during season five when the numbers really started to shoot up, as his salary entered the six digits per episode, pocketing $100,000 per episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the final two seasons, Aniston and the rest of the cast basically changed TV contract negotiations forever, making $1 million per episode.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>'Friends': Joey And Rachel Almost Cut Out Of Show, Jennifer Aniston Reveals</a></span></p><p>Although it came to an end in 2004, the residuals are still coming in hot. It is said that the cast makes $20 million per year off reruns, merchandise and so much more!</p><p>In addition, the cast got together for a reunion special on HBO, which was also very lucrative for the cast, making $2.5 million. Alongside People, Jen did admit that the experience of <a href=#>reuniting with the cast was a little tougher than she thought.</a></p><p>"I think it really took us all down way harder than we anticipated," Aniston tells host Rob Lowe. "Because in your mind, you think, 'Oh, this will be really fun to time travel.' It turns out, oh, ouch — it's kind of hard to time travel."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In truth, Aniston could've called it a career once the show wrapped up and live off the backend money alone. However, she is driven to continue on and now, she's thriving in a completely different role.</p><h2 id=39-the-morning-show-39-is-her-most-profitable-per-episode>'The Morning Show' Is Her Most Profitable Per Episode</h2><p>The terms for Jen on the show are huge, and the same can be said for her co-star Reese Witherspoon. With such contracts, Reese stated with The Hollywood Reporter that some <a href=#>people took exception to those kids of wages</a>. The actress made mention that they're fully merited and in truth, there should not be any confusion given their drawing power.</p><p>“There seemed to be a resentment, as if we weren’t worth it or it was bothersome, and I thought, ‘Why is that bothersome?’ ”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I guarantee these companies are real smart, and if they agree to pay us, they’re doing it for a reason. They probably had a lot of lawyers and a lot of business people decide on that number because they knew that they were going to make more than that back.” She pauses, briefly, and then continues: “Does it bother people when Kobe Bryant or LeBron James make their contract?”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon Shares BTS Clip With Jennifer Aniston On 'The Morning Show' Set</a></span></p><p>Hard to argue with the actress and given the show's success, the sum is well worth it. Aniston is making $2 million per episode. So for season 1, she made $20 million total.</p><p>In truth, it wasn't the easiest to film given the current circumstances going on in the world. <a href=#>Aniston reveals the struggle involved</a>, "Sorry that it took so long. What was that like during the pandemic? That was a challenge, to say the least. It was very hard. We were all a bit nervous to be going out there, even though we had an incredible epidemiology team to educate all of us on how this is going to work, how this is going to look, and testing and the protocols."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not to worry Jen, it was worth the wait!</p><h2 id=300-million-net-worth>$300 Million Net Worth</h2><p>These days, Aniston is doing more than okay with a net worth of $300 million.</p><p>Aside from acting, she has so many other revenues coming in, which includes a slew of endorsement deals alongside the likes of Vital Proteins, L'Oreal, Smartwater, Diet Coke, and oh so many others. It is said that she makes $5 million off Emirates Airlines alone. And let's not forget the slew of beauty products.</p><p>It is entirely possible that Jen inches towards the billion mark in the upcoming years. Especially if she continues to work on-camera, demanding such a big wage.</p><p>To sum up, she made greater total earnings on 'Friends', however on a per-episode basis, she's making a higher wage on 'The Morning Show'.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Vs.
