He was drafted by the Chargers in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft.</p><p>Allen won multiple rookie honors after setting Chargers’ records for receptions and receiving yards by a rookie. In 2017, he was named the Comeback Player of the Year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-age></span>Keenan Allen Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Keenan Alexander Allen is an American football wide receiver for the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League. He was born on April 27. 1992 in Greensboro, NC. Thus he is 27 years old as of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-family-keenan-allen-personal-life></span>Keenan Allen FAmily |&nbsp;Keenan Allen personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is the younger half-brother of quarterback Zach Maynard, who also played at Cal. The two brothers combined for the longest pass play in school history when they hooked up on a 90-yard score against the Washington Huskies.</p><p>They share a mother, Dorie Maynard-Lang, and Maynard’s biological father, Scott Lang, is Allen’s stepfather. Allen’s cousin, Maurice Harris, is an NFL wide receiver for the New England Patriots, with the two being teammates in high school and college.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-wife></span>Keenan Allen Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Keenan Allen’s wife is Ciandra Monique. He proposed to her in May of 2017 by the pool. His friend captured the whole thing on video and Keenan posted it later on social media. It was a smooth move. I wonder if the atmosphere obscured some of the game Keenan tossed out there. The music probably made it a little tough to hear.</p><p>It almost looks like Monique couldn’t hear some of the things Keenan told her since the music blared. All in all, though, a great proposal. One of Ciandra’s friends screamed like a banshee when he dropped the knee.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-education></span>Keenan Allen Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He attended Northern Guilford High School, where he played football, basketball, and ran track. In football, he was a standout on both sides of the ball for the Nighthawks football team.</p><p>He was a 2009 high school All-American, selected by USA Today and Parade, and also played in U.S. Army All-American Bowl, returning one punt for 33 yards as well as one kickoff also for 33 yards.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-net-worth></span>Keenan Allen Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On June 10. 2016, he agreed to a four-year, $45 million contract extension with the Chargers. His salary with the club is unknown. He has an estimated net worth of 1.5 million dollars of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chargers-keenan-allen-subtly-roasts-his-teams-lackluster-start></span>Chargers’ Keenan Allen Subtly Roasts His Team’s Lackluster Start<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After finishing 12-4 last season, Chargers fans were hopeful that their team could have a repeat season and end up back in the playoffs with a high seed.</p><p>Philip Rivers has been fairly consistent throughout his career and with the correct weapons around him, there were certainly quite a few pundits who felt like the Chargers could do some real damage this season. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case as the team is now 2-4 and always seems to be battling a deficit early in the game.</p><p>The team is rarely able to come back and some of the players are starting to get tired of what’s been happening. During a recent Twitter exchange, Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen replied to a fan who said the Chargers were repeating their fate every single game. In just two words, Allen let his feelings be known.</p><p>While Allen didn’t really expound upon this statement, the two words tell you all you need to know about how he feels right now. The team is in a massive hole and it will take quite a bit of digging for them to make the playoffs at this point. In just six games, they have matched their 16-game loss total from last year, which was definitely unexpected.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-college-keenan-allen-college-career></span>Keenan Allen College | Keenan Allen College Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Allen attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he began at wide receiver for the California Golden Bears football team from (2010 to 2012). As a freshman in the 2010 season, he had 46 receptions for 490 yards and five touchdowns. As a sophomore in the 2011 season, he had a career-high 98 catches for 1,343 yards.</p><p>As a junior in the 2012 season, he had 61 receptions for 737 yards and six touchdowns. He left Cal after his junior season having caught a school-record 205 passes, for 2,570 yards “third in school history” and 25 touchdowns”seventh”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-contract></span>Keenan Allen Contract<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Allen signed a 4 year, $45,000,000 contract with the San Diego Chargers, including a $9,500,000 signing bonus, $20,656,000 guaranteed, and an average annual salary of $11,250,000. In 2019, Allen will earn a base salary of $10,000,000 and a workout bonus of $250,000, while carrying a cap hit of $12,150,000 and a dead cap value of $3,800,000.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-injury></span>Keenan Allen Injury<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-suffers-hip-injury-in-chargers-victory></span>Keenan Allen suffers hip injury in Chargers’ victory<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chargers wide receiver Allen exited their clash with the Kansas City Chiefs in the second quarter with a hip injury. He did not return to the game in the Chargers’ 29-28 victory, but he returned to the sideline in the second half.<br>He suffered the injury while nearly pulling down an improbable touchdown reception. L.A. earned a first down on the play thanks to a Chiefs penalty.</p><p>Keenan had neither a target nor a reception at the time of his departure. The Chiefs were leading 14-7.</p><p>L.A. entered the game without its top two running backs, Melvin Gordon and Austin Ekeler, both of whom are injured.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-rotoworld></span>Keenan Allen Rotoworld<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-soaked-up-two-catches-for-75-yards-and-a-touchdown-on-six-targets-sunday-in-the-chargers-divisional-round-loss-to-new-england></span><strong style=font-size:16px>Keenan Allen soaked up two catches for 75 yards and a touchdown on six targets Sunday in the Chargers’ Divisional Round loss to New England.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He broke free for a 43-yard touchdown in the first quarter, eluding All-Pro cornerback Stephon Gilmore with a brilliant double-move down the right sideline. That grab stood as the Chargers’ longest play from scrimmage. Allen nearly added a second touchdown in the fourth quarter, beating Devin McCourty for a 32-yard gain to set up first-and-goal at the half-yard-line.</p><p>Virgil Green scored on the next play with he contributing a two-point conversion. Though the season ended on a sour note for Los Angeles, Allen had an excellent year statistically, topping 1,000 yards receiving for the third time in his career. He’ll be in the WR1 discussion in fantasy drafts this summer.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-hauled-in-4-of-6-targets-for-37-yards-in-the-chargers-wild-card-win-over-the-ravens></span><strong>Keenan Allen hauled in 4-of-6 targets for 37 yards in the Chargers’ Wild Card win over the Ravens.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Allen could not come up with a floated pass which would have given him a few more yards, but he had little hope for a big day in a game Philip Rivers threw for just 160 yards. He was able to come up with a big third-down catch in the second quarter, however, and will get another shot next week in New England. Allen is a good bet for a bounce-back in that spot.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-caught-4-of-7-targets-for-64-yards-in-the-chargers-week-17-win-over-the-broncos></span><strong>Keenan Allen caught 4-of-7 targets for 64 yards in the Chargers’ Week 17 win over the Broncos.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Allen finishes the regular season four yards shy of his second straight 1,200-yard campaign. He has a tough Wild Card assignment in the Ravens’ elite secondary.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-2016-season></span>Keenan Allen 2016 season<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On June 10. 2016, he agreed to a four-year, $45 million contract extension with the Chargers. In the 2016 season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, Allen was down on the field in pain with less than two minutes to go in the first half and was carted off the field. He was diagnosed with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear and missed the rest of the season.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-2018-season></span>Keenan Allen 2018 season<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Allen started off the season off with eight receptions for 108 yards and a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs.[59] On November 4, against the Seattle Seahawks, he had six receptions for 124 yards.[60] Following the Seahawks game, he went on a stretch of five consecutive games with a receiving touchdown.</p><p>His best game in that stretch was a 14-catch, 148-yard game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Overall, he finished the 2018 season with 97 receptions for 1,196 receiving yards and six receiving touchdowns. In the Wild Card Round, he had four receptions for 37 yards in the 23–17 win over the Baltimore Ravens. In the Divisional Round loss to the New England Patriots, he had two receptions for 75 yards and a touchdown.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-stats></span>Keenan Allen Stats<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table style=height:259px border=2/ width=547 cellspacing=2/ cellpadding=2/><tbody><tr><td nowrap width=57>Year</td><td nowrap width=170>Team</td><td nowrap width=46><p align=center>REC</p></td><td nowrap width=46><p align=center>YDS</p></td><td nowrap width=46><p align=center>AVG</p></td><td nowrap width=45><p align=center>LNG</p></td><td nowrap width=39><p align=center>TD</p></td><td nowrap width=43><p align=center>ATT</p></td><td nowrap width=45><p align=center>YDS</p></td><td nowrap width=46><p align=center>AVG</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=10></td></tr><tr><td width=57>2018</td><td width=170>&nbsp;<p>Chargers</p></td><td valign=top width=46><p align=center>97</p></td><td valign=top width=46>1,196</td><td valign=top width=46><p align=center>12.3</p></td><td valign=top width=45><p align=center>54</p></td><td valign=top width=39><p align=center>6</p></td><td valign=top width=43><p align=center>9</p></td><td valign=top width=45><p align=center>75</p></td><td valign=top width=46><p align=center>8.3</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=10></td></tr><tr><td width=57>2017</td><td width=170>&nbsp;<p>Chargers</p></td><td valign=top width=46><p align=center>102</p></td><td valign=top width=46><p align=center>1,393</p></td><td valign=top width=46><p align=center>13.7</p></td><td valign=top width=45><p align=center>51</p></td><td valign=top width=39><p align=center>6</p></td><td valign=top width=43><p align=center>2</p></td><td valign=top width=45><p align=center>9</p></td><td valign='2/"top"' width=2/><p align='2/"center"'>4.5</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chargers-fantasy-preview-keenan-allen-looks-to-rebound-vs-pittsburgh></span>Chargers Fantasy Preview: Keenan Allen looks to rebound vs. Pittsburgh<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Los Angeles Chargers are looking to bounce back from a Week 5 loss to the Denver Broncos while fantasy players are looking for more from Melvin Gordon and Keenan Allen.</p><p>Since the Chargers couldn’t find the pay dirt on offense in Week 5 vs. Denver, fantasy options on the team struggled. Austin Ekeler in PPR leagues was probably the best performer on the team. This week, the Chargers should get into the end zone more often vs. the Steelers. With Keenan Allen and Melvin Gordon looking to rebound, as well as quarterback Philip Rivers, who should team owners go with this week? Let’s get into this Week 6 fantasy preview.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-running-game></span>The running game<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Last week, the dynamic in the rushing attack started to change vs. Denver. Gordon got more carries in his first game back with 12 carries and four receptions. Ekeler on the other hand only had three carries but finished with 15 receptions for a fairly good day.</p><p>Ultimately, the problem in the game vs. Denver was that the Chargers went down 17-0 fairly quickly, making it harder to run the ball at a certain point. Considering the opponent in the Devlin Hodges-led Steelers, there should be more time of possession for the offense and as a consequence, more carries for the running backs.</p><p>Until Gordon returns to form and starts ripping off touchdowns or big chunk plays with more touches, both Ekeler and Gordon should be starting running backs in your league. When Gordon asserts himself as the No. 1 running back, it may be time to consider Ekeler a very high flex option as opposed to a starter. Continue to roll with both as starters in your leagues for the moment.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-defense></span>The defense<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Hodges seems to be the wild card in this situation. The Pittsburgh offense will go as far as he takes them in this game. It’s worth pointing out that he actually played pretty well last week in limited time vs. Baltimore, almost rallying the team to a win. However, the first start for a quarterback is a completely different environment, especially for one that was a third-stringer coming into the year.</p><p>Will Hodges’ start result in the fantasy payoff that the infamous Nathan Peterman game provided for the defense? Probably not quite that level. It may not matter though considering that the Steelers are ranked 29th in total offense before Hodges even starts. The Chargers will limit the Steelers’ offense and control the clock. Start them if they’re on your team already or available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=broncos-cb-chris-harris-responds-to-keenan-allens-insults></span>Broncos CB Chris Harris responds to Keenan Allen’s insults<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Broncos cornerback<strong> Chris Harris</strong> held Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen to a season-low four catches for 18 yards in Denver’s 20-13 win on the road last week. Allen was clearly displeased after the game and reacted to fans on Instagram who were praising Harris.</p><p>“Now, y’all know damn well that boy can’t hold my jockstrap,” Allen said. “Stop it.” ESPN’s Eric Williams brought up the social media comments in the Chargers’ locker room last Thursday and Allen doubled-down on his bad take.</p><p>“Go watch the tape, man,” Allen said. “It’s not a secret.”</p><p>The tape reveals that Harris has gotten the best of Allen since 2017.</p><p>After the Broncos defeated the Titans on Sunday, Harris was asked about Allen’s remarks.</p><p>“I’ve locked him up numerous times,” Harris said. “I don’t even know how many times I’ve shut him down. There’s nothing to really talk about with him. I’m ready for (Chiefs wide receiver) Tyreek Hill.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=denver-will-host-kansas-city-on-thursday-evening></span>Denver will host Kansas City on Thursday evening.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This isn’t the first time Allen has talked smack about the Broncos.</p><p>After the Chargers lost to Denver last November, the wide receiver told reporters “they suck.” It seems like Allen is just a sore loser.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keenan-allen-instagram></span>Keenan Allen Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKOVmruiuoyao6WdnmKvqruMmp6eZZmjt7a%2B2Gauop6VYrCwuMuenp5lkaOxbq%2FOp6urmZOpenN7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./marlon-wayans-la-home-burglarized-while-keenan-wayans-slept-inside.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marlon Wayans LA Home Burglarized While Keenan Wayans Slept Inside">&larr;
