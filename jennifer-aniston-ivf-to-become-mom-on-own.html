No more so than when being constantly bombarded about when the time would come to start a family. And whether it would be done naturally or if a <a href=#>baby would be adopted</a>. Little did the outlets know that the actress had already been trying for years to get pregnant. A journey that proved to be unsuccessful without intervention. And because of this, Aniston turned to IVF to attempt to have a dream of becoming a mother realized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Jennifer Aniston Has Said About Motherhood</a></span></p><p>This is why now that Jennifer Aniston has admitted she underwent IVF, speculation exists about whether she was trying to become a mother on her own.</p><h2 id=when-jennifer-aniston-started-her-ivf-journey>When Jennifer Aniston Started Her IVF Journey</h2><p>When Aniston and Brad Pitt got married in 2000, there was an expectation that the two would have children together. As such, the couple was constantly under the media microscope just waiting to see when a baby bump would appear. <a href=#>A baby bump that never came to fruition</a> as the marriage ended with divorce in 2005.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A divorce that Aniston was blamed for, for refusing to get pregnant</a>, something that has been categorically denied by the Friends alum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while she may have been struggling to get pregnant during this time, IVF was not yet even being considered by Aniston.</p><p>While there has been a recent admission that IVF was something that Aniston tried in order to expand her family, when that exactly occurred is a bit blurry. Only a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rough timeframe has been given by Aniston</a> as to when she sought help for her infertility.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Jennifer Aniston Never Had Kids</a></span></p><p>The Murder Mystery star explained that it was during her late thirties and into her early forties when she was actively trying to get pregnant via IVF. This seems to have been a time in her life when Aniston was not married and may not have officially been in a relationship with anyone.</p><p>Something that gives credence to the notion that IVF was a means to an end of Aniston fulfilling the desire to start a family, with or without the help of a partner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-39-s-consideration-of-having-children-alone>Jennifer Aniston's Consideration Of Having Children Alone</h2><p>While Aniston may not have been in a relationship at the beginning of her late thirties, by the time she was in her forties, that had changed. This is because she reconnected with Justin Theroux in 2010, the year that Aniston turned forty.</p><p>As Aniston moved through her early forties, she was still connected to Theroux. In fact, the couple got engaged in 2012. Meaning that Theroux was a huge part of the Horrible Bosses star's life and would have been there as Aniston moved forward with IVF.</p><p>Whether he was to be the father of the baby if the fertility intervention proved to be successful is unknown. But, by the time the couple chose to get married in 2015, by Aniston's timeline, she would have been done trying to get pregnant via IVF.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Something that perhaps proved to be a decision to make, given that Theroux <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented on the Allure interview with a "fist bump and a heart emoji."</a> Showing that the <a href=#>actor still has a soft place in his heart</a> and is willing to give support when it comes to his ex in the years after their divorce.</p><p>Based on Aniston's timeline, it would appear that she would not have had a problem tackling the motherhood journey without a partner if IVF had not worked.</p><p>But, given how soon after she may have tried IVF that Theroux entered the picture, Aniston may never have truly been in a position to have considered raising a baby on her own.</p><h2 id=will-jennifer-aniston-try-ivf-now>Will Jennifer Aniston Try IVF Now?</h2><p>Throughout her marriage to Theroux, Aniston was under a constant media barrage with everyone wanting to see if they would be able to break the news first about a baby being on the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As such, if there was anything other than a flat stomach, rumors swirled about Aniston being pregnant.</p><p>That coupled with the LolaVie founder's attempts to try anything to help the IVF process become successful by "throwing everything at it" made for a less-than-conducive environment in which to conceive. Something that may have been the final straw when it came to closing the chapter on trying to have a baby.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Refuses To Answer Why She Never Had Children, Despite Incessant Questions</a></span></p><p>And that chapter is closed.</p><p>Aniston explained to Allure that she does not have any regrets about that time in her life. Instead, there is a sense of "relief" that has come with moving on to a place where having a baby is no longer a topic of conversation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"That ship has sailed," Aniston stated. "...There is no more 'Can I? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.' I don't have to think about that anymore."</p><p>And with those days behind her, Aniston appears to feel freer to choose that path in life that is right for her. A chance to start a new and exciting chapter in her life that is filled with much more joy and far less drama than previously experienced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddmbalecmepaehlpq%2Fbq3Noqqtp55isbB5yK%2BdZq%2BZqbVw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./laphonza-butler-net-worth-how-much-is-senator-butler-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Laphonza Butler Net Worth  How Much is Senator Butler Worth?">&larr;
