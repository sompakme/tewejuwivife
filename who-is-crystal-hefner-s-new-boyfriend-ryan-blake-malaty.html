Here's everything you should know about him and their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Purchased The Playboy Mansion After Hugh Hefner's Passing For $100 Million?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-was-crystal-hefner-amp-nathan-levi-39-s-relationship-like>What Was Crystal Hefner & Nathan Levi's Relationship Like?</h2><p>The two were first linked in July 2020 when they were spotted kissing at the Casa de Mita resort in Mexico. Shortly after, Hefner made the relationship Instagram-official. She posted a photo of them together with the caption, "You feel like home." The couple kept a low profile but would often post sweet messages to each other. In August 2020, they went on a trip to Punta Mita, Mexico to celebrate Levi's birthday. "Happy birthday to my favorite person," Hefner captioned their photo. "Glad we could get away together for your special day."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The spaceship engineer even wrote a longer caption about the occasion. "Sometimes our lives can change in the blink of an eye... When they do, it's really important to stop and take it all in, smell the proverbial roses," he said. "If you're lucky, sometimes life will give you real roses! When it does, nothing can compare. Being with you has been one of the best changes in my life and the roses have never been more real! Thank you for making the start of my 32nd year of life better than I could have dreamed @crystalhefner."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The relationship seemed steady for a while. But in May 2021, Hefner announced her diagnosis with a rare heart rhythm disorder called Long QT syndrome following a quiet split from Levi. "I've been surrounding myself with people I love and trying to take things easy lately. I'm healing from things in my life and growing as a person," she wrote on Instagram. "On top of the health related things I'm still healing from, I was recently diagnosed with a rare heart rhythm disorder called 'long qt' syndrome. I've been lucky to find people on social media who have it as well and they've helped me tremendously."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did 'Harry Potter' Star Scarlett Byrne End Up Married To Hugh Hefner's Son?</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-crystal-hefner-39-s-new-man-ryan-malaty>Who Is Crystal Hefner's New Man Ryan Malaty?</h2><p>Malaty is a 32-year-old actor from New York.

She added that death is a tough subject for her, as well as discussing her life in the mansion. It's exactly why she keeps her personal life private.</p><p>"That day was very hard," she said of Hef's passing. "I have lost a lot of people in my life, and death is a difficult topic for me.⁣ ⁣I chose to be more private over the years because I'm an introvert at heart and while the mansion in some ways was a sanctuary, in other ways, I was exploited like never before. ⁣I've been on the fence about telling my story because it’s complicated and conflicting in ways."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Hugh Hefner's Son Reveals The Moment His Dad Canceled Donald Trump</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBur9Gyqq2ZnGK1prLNnqmsZZ6axG6uzrKdq6GVo7FuvtiapWaanJa4pnnMmqOarKlk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./you-can-t-take-his-talent-away.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="&amp;quot;You Can't Take His Talent Away&amp;quot;">&larr;
