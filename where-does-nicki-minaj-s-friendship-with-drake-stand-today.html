At the beginning of their careers, both rap superstars often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">led fans to believe that they were a couple</a> given how affectionate they were with each other during live performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Drake was always quick to gush about how he wanted to marry Nicki, but according to the “Super Bass” hitmaker, her relationship with Drizzy was never more than just a very close friendship. Over the years, however, the pair have shared several feuds.</p><p>When Drake paired up with Cardi B for two of his OVO shows, sources claimed Nicki was enraged seeing that she wasn’t on good terms with the Bronx native, and since Drake was supposed to be her friend, it seemed as if he was taking sides by inviting the “I Like It” star to his concerts. But where does their relationship stand today?</p><h2 id=nicki-and-drake-are-they-friends-again>Nicki And Drake: Are They Friends Again?</h2><p>Nicki’s friendship with Drake was drastically affected after the latter ended his two-year feud with rapper Meek Mill, who dated the self-proclaimed Queen of Rap for two years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was no secret that when Meek and Drake were beefing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki said she stopped talking to the Canadian chart-topper</a> because she didn’t want to get involved in the drama and make it seem as if she had taken her friend’s side over the man she once claimed was the love of her life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Fans Think Megan Thee Stallion Is Feuding With Erica Banks</a></span></p><p>Meek had taken shots at the “Hotline Bling” star in 2015, claiming he’d been using a ghostwriter to pen most of his hit records, which later backfired as Drake would release two earth-shattering diss tracks, "Charged Up" and "Back To Back."</p><p>Meek had undoubtedly lost the fight with the 34-year-old, yet Nicki chose to stand by her then-boyfriend by not associating herself with the fiasco, but it went without saying that distancing herself from Drake ultimately affected the close bond she once shared with him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By September 2018, Drake and Meek squashed their beef, which was not only surprising to fans but also Nicki, who was left bothered after Drizzy had invited her rap rival Cardi B on stage at his OVO Festival on two occasions, giving her the impression that her pal clearly had no loyalty to her or their friendship.</p><p>In 2019, she accused Meek and Drake of “trying to end me” in her song “Barbie Going Bad,” and while she never elaborated on what exactly she meant by the lyric, clearly Nicki knew something was going on behind the scenes that we didn’t, though she never addressed the matter again after that.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans On Twitter Share Overwhelming Love To Nicki Minaj After Her Father’s Tragic Passing</a></span></p><p>Fortunately, however, things were looking up for the “Moment 4 Life” collaborators following the birth of Nicki’s son in October 2020.</p><p>Just weeks after welcoming her child, she would release her song with rapper Sara Baby titled “Whole Lotta Choppas Remix,” where she raps, “This n****a makin’ me feel erotic/Uh, he a freak like Giannis/To be honest, I hope one day we do a play-date with Adonis.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the lyrics quickly spread around social media, it didn’t take long for Drake, whose son’s name is Adonis, to give his reaction by posting a screenshot of the song’s artwork on his Instagram Story along with the words, “Play dates soon come.”</p><p>Many perceived this as Drake letting fans know that things were good between him and Nicki — it was also the first time he had publicly acknowledged her since his interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rap Radar</a> in December 2019, where he admitted that the Meek Mill feud changed his friendship with Nicki “probably forever.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Was Mariah Carey And Nicki Minaj’s ‘American Idol’ Feud Real Or A Publicity Stunt?</a></span></p><p>Drake and Nicki Minaj are two of the most successful rappers of all-time, having worked on a handful of hits together including “Only,” “Make Me Proud,” “No Frauds,” “Champions,” “Up All Night,” “Truffle Butter,” and, of course, their platinum-selling single “Moment 4 Life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given their history and how long they’ve known each other, fans strongly hoped that whatever issues had transpired between them over the years would eventually subside, and from the look of things, both parties are open to working on their relationship again.</p><p>Nicki is said to be finishing up work on her forthcoming fifth studio album, which is believed to drop later this year. If her friendship with Drake is back intact, it wouldn’t be far-fetched to believe the latter could very well be featured on her next record.</p><p>Would you be excited about a new song from the pair?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Minaj’s Fans Are Convinced Her Ex Meek Mill Is Still Obsessed With Her</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqlu8SsZKehk6C2brnIp5ijq12bv6qxzZ2qoaGgYsSqwMdmm6uZm5p6tMDAp5tmrJ%2BZrrp7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ariana-grande-and-pete-davidson-the-way-they-were.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson: The Way They Were">&larr;
