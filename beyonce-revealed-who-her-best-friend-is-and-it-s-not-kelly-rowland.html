Not only has Beyonce become one of the biggest stars in the world, but she has taken on a number of projects throughout her career that have solidified her spot as a true artist and icon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyonce first began her career as a member of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Destiny's Child</a>, which also included Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. The legendary trio managed to come out with hit song after hit song securing their spot as one of the most successful girl groups in music history. Despite no longer being together, Bey is extremely close with both Kelly and Michelle, however, who does she consider to be her best friend?</p><p>While fans always assume Kelly and Beyonce are the closest, since they quite literally grew up together, it appears as if they aren't best friends. During an interview with Oprah Winfrey, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce </a>revealed who her real BFF is, and you'd be surprised to know that it isn't Kelly or Michelle. Let's get into it!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Pics Show How Beyonce Has Changed Over The Years (Or Not)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=battle-of-the-besties>Battle Of The Besties</h2><p>Beyonce, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams were once upon a time taking over the world of music, performing across the world and selling millions upon millions of albums as the legendary girl group, Destiny's Child. If you weren't saying their name, paying their bills, or weren't ready for all that jelly, then it's time to take a stroll down memory lane and get your Destiny's Child on because they are not a group to be slept on.</p><p>When it came down to who was closer to who, fans always believed that Kelly Rowland and Beyonce were much closer than with Michelle. Although this was true since both Kelly and Beyonce had grown up together and were the two original members of the group, Michelle was very much part of the trio and it was equal love all around.</p><p>The women joined Beyonce during her 2013 Super Bowl Halftime Show and again in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 at Beyonce's headline performance at Coachella.</a> While the girls are no longer actively making music, they've certainly still got a great bond, a bond that has led many to believe that Bey and Kelly are besties, when in fact, Kelly has got some competition!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Known Facts About Beyonce's Sister, Solange Knowles</a></span></p><h2 id=blue-ivy-takes-the-lead>Blue Ivy Takes The Lead</h2><p>In 2012, Beyonce and Jay-Z's life changed for the best. The iconic duo welcomed their first child together, Blue Ivy Carter. A year after giving birth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce sat down with Oprah Winfrey for a one-on-one interview</a> regarding her new life as a mother. While Oprah's questions had Beyonce struggling to find the words to express her love for her daughter, she managed to find them and explained the journey as "joyful" and how "my daughter introduced me to myself".</p><p>Beyonce's face lit up when the topic if Blue Ivy came up and she was all smiles for the remainder of the interview. When it came time to describe their connection, Beyonce made sure that people knew that Blue Ivy was her everything, including her best friend. Beyonce continued to describe the "connection" the two share and how unparalleled it is to anything she's ever felt towards another human before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While choosing your 13-month-old daughter as your "best friend" might be too easy, that's what Beyonce said, and who are we to question anything Beyonce says. This obviously does not mean that Kelly and Bey aren't close, but when it comes to the number one girl in Beyonce's life, it isn't Kelly, not even Bey's sister, Solange or mother, Tina Knowles, it's Blue Ivy and Blue Ivy only.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Was Beyonce Before Jay-Z?</a></span></p><h2 id=beyonce-amp-motherhood>Beyonce & Motherhood</h2><p>Flashforward to June 13, 2017, and Beyonce welcomed her twin babies, Rumi and Sir Carter, expanding the family even more. With three kids now, Beyonce has taken on the role of being a mother as best as she could, and according to Bey's mom, Tina Knowles, she has managed to do an excellent job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Beyonce has allowed Blue Ivy to join the limelight with red carpet appearances, collaborating on both Bey and Jay's music, attending NBA games, the whole works! However, Bey and Jay have taken a different approach with their soon to be 3-year-old twins. It is no surprise that the family is very private and rightfully so. When you are amongst the most famous people in the world, chances are you will try to keep your kids as innocent as possible for as long as possible.</p><p>Beyonce has proven herself as a singer, songwriter, actress, producer and now, mother. It appears as if there is not a single job that Beyonce cannot do. As Blue Ivy has gotten older, she and Bey have been able to share a lot more moments together, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their time shooting Beyonce's "Spirit" music video</a>. So, if Blue was Bey's bestie at 13 months, it's only fitting to assume that the two are even closer now than ever before.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce Helped Put These Stars On The Map</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnrGfo7CmedGerZ6ZnJqxbsPHqGShnaJir6a%2F02adq6GVo7FutdJmmKecXZ7BtHnNqKtmo5Whubp50aiupZmemXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./busta-rhymes-feat-eminem-calm-down-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Busta Rhymes Feat.
