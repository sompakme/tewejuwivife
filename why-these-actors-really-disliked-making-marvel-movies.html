Whether it was pay disputes, a hatred of being sat in the makeup chairs for hours or an issue with how their character was edited, some stars have spoken negatively about their experience working on the blokbusters.</p><p>Here are just some of the reasons why these actors hated making Marvel movies.</p><h2 id=terence-howard-wasn-39-t-happy-with-his-marvel-pay><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Terence Howard Wasn't Happy With His Marvel Pay</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/terence-howard-iron-man.png><p>Iron Man actor Terence Howard received $3.5 to $5 million for playing Tony Stark’s wingman James Rhodey, this was six times more than Robert Downey Jr. After this superhero film was a massive success, Downey received a HUGE pay increase and Howard did not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Howard believes that he had helped convince studio execs to hire the then-disgraced Downey in the first place and hoped to get something in return. “I called Robby… leaving messages with his assistants, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">called him at least 17 times that day</a> and 21 the next and finally left a message saying, ‘look, man, I need the help that I gave you’. Never heard from him…And guess who got the millions I was supposed to get?”</p><p>According to early conversations with his agent and Marvel, Howard allegedly was looking for an $8 million payday, yet was offered $1 million. Instead of taking a pay decrease,<a href=#> he was replaced with Don Cheadle.</a></p><h2 id=hugo-weaving-had-contract-issues-with-marvel><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Hugo Weaving Had Contract Issues With Marvel</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hugo-Weaving-Red-Skull-Screenrant.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hugo Weaving played the villainous Red Skull in the first Captain America and is unfailingly polite while clearly not interested in repeating the experience.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s not something I would want to do again</a>,” he told Collider. “It’s not the sort of film I seek out and really am excited by.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why These 11 Stars Will Never Do A Marvel Movie">Why These 11 Stars Will Never Do A Marvel Movie</a></span></p><p>His character appears in Avengers: Infinity War, just not played by Weaving! This wasn't necessarily because he didn't want to return. “Oh, yeah. I loved playing that character Red Skull – it was a lot of fun. We were all obliged to sign up for three pictures: I was thinking [Red Skull] probably wouldn’t come back in ‘Captain America’ but he may well come back as a villain in ‘The Avengers,'” Weaving revealed to Time Out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“By then, they’d pushed back on the contracts that we agreed on and so the money they offered me for ‘The Avengers’ was much less than I got for the very first one, and this was for two films. And the promise when we first signed the contracts was that the money would grow each time. They said: ‘It’s just a voice job, it’s not a big deal.’ I actually found negotiating with them through my agent impossible. And I didn’t really wanna do it that much. But I would have done it.”</p><h2 id=anthony-hopkins-found-it-acting-in-marvel-movie-to-be-39-pointless-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Anthony Hopkins Found It Acting In Marvel Movie To Be 'Pointless'</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Thor-Ragnarok-Odin-Hero-Poster.jpg><p>Anthony Hopkins appeared in the Thor franchise as Odin, the ruler of Asgard.

They put me in armor; they shoved a beard on me. Sit on the throne; shout a bit. If you’re sitting in front of a green screen, it’s pointless acting it.”</p><h2 id=idris-elba-struggled-to-play-marvel-39-s-heimdall-after-other-roles><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Idris Elba Struggled To Play Marvel's Heimdall After Other Roles</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/idris-elba-marvel-s-heimdall.jpg><p>Idris Elba had spent eight months playing iconic activist Nelson Mandela before returning to the role of Heimdall in Thor: The Dark World and he struggled to find worth in the filmmaking process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He didn't want to be there for the reshoots, but his agent told him, "You have to, it’s part of the deal."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="10 Marvel Actors Who Disliked Their Superhero Costumes">10 Marvel Actors Who Disliked Their Superhero Costumes</a></span></p><p>He told the Daily Telegraph, “In between takes I was stuck there, fake hair stuck on to my head with glue, this f***ing helmet, while they reset. And I’m thinking: ‘24 hours ago, I was Mandela’…Then there I was, in this stupid harness, with this wig and this sword and these contact lenses. It ripped my heart out.”</p><p>Despite his issues with the process, he did reprise his role in Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity War.</p><h2 id=mickey-rourke-was-let-down-by-iron-man-2-edits><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Mickey Rourke Was Let Down By Iron Man 2 Edits</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/908D7D28-6146-46B1-BC41-8E255945816A.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mickey Rourke played the villain Whiplash in Iron Man 2 but felt like he was let down by the filmmakers. Years later he is still throwing digs at the franchise.</p><p>Rourke told Seth Meyers, “I’m not a Marvel fan… Once I did a movie for Marvel, and they cut the whole goddamn thing out.”</p><p>In another interview, he once again took a dig at the studio for cutting him out. “I explained to [Jon] Favreau that I wanted to bring some other layers and colors, not just make this Russian a complete murderous revenging bad guy. And they allowed me to do that. Unfortunately, the [people] at Marvel just wanted a one-dimensional bad guy, so most of the performance ended up [on] the floor.”</p><p>Rourke added, “At the end of the day you’ve got some nerd with a pocketful of money calling the shots. You know, Favreau didn’t call the shots.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Portman had championed director Patty Jenkins but was blindsided when the Wonder Woman director was fired (news she learned about through the media).</p><p>At this point, Portman had to stay on to make the poorly-received sequel, due to contractual obligations. Although she did not speak in public about the deal, she apparently wasn't shy about her distaste for Marvel behind the scenes.</p><p>Although she didn’t film new scenes for Endgame, she did provide some voice-over and showed up to the film’s premiere.
