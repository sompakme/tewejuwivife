If there's one thing that fans know about the sometimes <a href=#>controversial Call Her Daddy podcast</a>, it's that stars are going to talk about topics that they might not elsewhere.</p><p>When <strong>Mischa Barton was interviewed </strong>on Call Her Daddy in February 2024, she shared stories about The O.C. and also got super personal. While fans have heard about <a href=#>Mischa Barton's behavior on set</a> and they know that her character <strong>Marissa Cooper was killed off in the season 3 finale</strong>, the actress hasn't opened up that much in interviews. In this article, we'll take a look at what Mischa Barton told Alex Cooper about her love life, along with some other fascinating reveals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mischa-barton-talked-about-ben-mckenzie-and-her-dating-life-in-her-call-her-daddy-interview>Mischa Barton Talked About Ben McKenzie And Her Dating Life In Her Call Her Daddy Interview</h2><p>When Mischa Barton was interviewed by Alex Cooper for the Call Her Daddy episode that was released on, she shared a few details about dating Ben McKenzie. She said, "That was my first" relationship and added, "I had no idea what I was doing." She explained that there was an age difference as <strong>she was 17 years old when dating the 25-year-old </strong>actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/mischa-barton-ben-mckenzie-graduation-the-o-c.jpg><p>However, <strong>Mischa Barton spilled about her love life </strong>and was more vulnerable than she has been in other interviews. When Alex Cooper asked what Barton is looking for in her next relationship, Barton said that she <strong>changed her perspective on dating</strong>. She said that she used to be interested in only going out with musicians, but said, "Those days are over. That's not attractive to me anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She shared that when she was a twentysomething, she found it "cool" to date someone who was on tour. But now that she's older, she doesn't want that anymore.</p><p>Chances are that many people can relate to her. Even if someone didn't date famous singers or band members, they can understand wanting to be in a relationship with someone mature. While of course many musicians live stable lives, it sounds like Barton prioritized having a good time when she was younger. She didn't share the names of any musicians she dated, however.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-call-her-daddy-s-most-shocking-moments-reveal-the-point-of-alex-cooper-s-podcast-2.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Has Mischa Barton Dated?</a> (According to Hollywood Life)</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Brandon Davis (2004-2005)</strong></li><li><strong>Cisco Adler (August 2005-February 2007)</strong></li><li><strong>James Abercrombie (2017-2019)</strong></li><li><strong>Gian Marco Flamini (2021-unknown)</strong></li></ul><p>Barton talked about the kind of person she wants to date now and said:</p><p>"I like people who are driven and have their own stuff going on.

When Cooper brought up that some paparazzi would hand cell phones to strangers who could take pictures of celebrities, Barton confirmed that was true.</p><p><strong>Mischa Barton's Notable Movie And TV Roles</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Kyra Collins in The Sixth Sense (1999)</strong></li><li><strong>Mary "Mouse" Bedford in Lost And Delirious (2001)</strong></li><li><strong>Katie Singer in Once And Again (2001-2002)</strong></li><li><strong>Marissa Cooper in The O.C.

She said:</p><p>"It was put into the contract that I had to have a sober coach with me... I was being watched 24/7."</p><p>She continued that when she walked into her house at one point, various people from her agency and other teams were there and they asked if she could keep working. It felt like everyone was obsessed with her earning money and keeping her career going.

She said that she never believed she would live past a certain age because she was struggling so much. She talked about the partying that she did and explained:</p><p>"I thought I was going to be dead by 27. I was going to be part of that 27 club. It was like, live young and fast... I was reckless. I was over it. I didn't want to be doing stuff for other people anymore..."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued that she "romanticized" the hard lifestyle that she had and referred to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DUI that she got in 2008</a>. According to Entertainment Weekly, she was in West Hollywood, California just before 3 a.m. when she was arrested. She also mentioned being given a roofie, which is terrifying to hear about. She said, "I don't think I realized how dangerous that seedy side of L.A. can be."</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mischa Barton struggled a lot</a> in her younger years, she hasn't talked much about these dark times publicly. This makes her Call Her Daddy interview so important. As E! News reported, she went through a lot, including ending up in the <strong>hospital in 2009</strong>. While a source said that she wanted to take her own life, Barton said on The View that she was using painkillers because her tooth got infected. As fans can tell from her interview, Mischa Barton is much happier now, and it's really nice to see her thriving.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikoquTna5ursCrq6imXZeyr3nMnKKepqqesm6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mmpqknGK1pr6MnZidnKlitq%2FAxKutop2nYr%2BmwsSlmK2hn6PAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./neil-strauss-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Neil Strauss Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
