But despite their devastation, they've still taken to Twitter to share memes.</p><h2 id=fans-said-that-bob-odenkirk-was-robbed>Fans Said That Bob Odenkirk Was "Robbed"</h2><p>It's no secret that anyone who's watched Better Call Saul has been simply blown away by the performance of Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Was Michael McKean's Career Before Better Call Saul</a></span></p><p>But despite Odenkirk's fantastic performance which gave a funny caricature of a lawyer emotional depth, it was Squid Game actor Lee Jung-jae, who played Seong Gi-hun in the gripping survival drama, who won the Emmy for Lead Actor in a Drama series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee Jung-jae is the first Asian actor to win best drama actor</a> at the Emmys, and it comes as no surprise to see Squid Game take home Emmys after its overwhelming success on Netflix in 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rhea Seehorn's Life And Career That Led Her To 'Better Call Saul'</a></span></p><p>After the winners at the Emmys were revealed, fans of Better Call Saul took to Twitter to share their disappointment.</p><h2 id=how-did-better-call-saul-fans-react-to-no-emmy-wins>How Did Better Call Saul Fans React To No Emmy Wins?</h2><p>Fans were so furious at Better Call Saul's lack of wins that "WHAT A SICK JOKE" trended on Twitter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Better Call Saul. The masterclass in acting, writing, directing, and cinematography. Zero wins," one fan tweeted. "WHAT A SICK JOKE."</p><p>"Kim Wexler" also trended on Twitter as people shared their outrage at Rhea Seahorn, who played the professional fast-thinking lawyer and wife of Jimmy McGill, not winning an Emmy for her stunning and <a href=#>final portrayal of Kim Wexler</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jonathan Banks Had An Impressive Career Even Before Breaking Bad And Better Call Saul</a></span></p><p>No one understood how Better Call Saul missed out again in its sixth year.
