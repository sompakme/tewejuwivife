But this star was in the limelight long before this rumor and <a href=#>will most likely stay in it once it’s old news</a>. Both a singer and an actress, Sabrina has appeared in all sorts of different media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Sabrina Carpenter Amassed Her Reported $4 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>And celebrity drama aside, Sabrina Carpenter has been working non-stop both on screen and on stage which is why she was listed in 2021's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes’ 30 under 30</a> (under the Hollywood & Entertainment category). So the real question isn’t really whether she does more singing or acting, but which of the two has earned her the big bucks and <a href=#>secured her $4 million net worth</a>.</p><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-39-s-disney-channel-days><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Sabrina Carpenter's Disney Channel Days</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Sabrina got her start with her breakout role as Maya Hart in the Disney channel series Girl Meets World</a>. A spin-off of the classic Boy Meets World, Carpenter appears as the wild and artistic best friend to Riley Matthews, the daughters of two of the main characters from the original. She appeared on the show from 2014 to 2017 where she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated to have made around $8000 to $10,000 for each episode</a>. She also starred in Disney Channel’s 100th original movie Adventures in Babysitting which earned 3.45 million views during its premiere.</p><h2 id=39-can-rsquo-t-blame-a-girl-for-trying-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>'Can’t Blame A Girl For Trying'</span></h2><p>The same year as her introduction as Maya, Sabrina Carpenter dabbled with her music career as she signed with Hollywood Records. She released the EP Can’t Blame A Girl For Trying, which many compared to Taylor Swift’s early country work. The following year, Carpenter released her first studio album called Eyes Wide Open. The pop album sold over 12,000 copies in just the first few weeks of the initial release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-is-an-animation-queen><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sabrina Carpenter Is An Animation Queen</span></h2><p>But Sabrina’s acting abilities aren’t just shown through her physical appearance as she has a vast array of voice acting roles on her acting belt. She appeared as Princess Vivan in the beloved princess series Sofia the First. She also lent her voice as Melissa Chase in the animated series Milo Murphy's Law (a show that takes place in the same universe as Phineas & Ferb, a series Carpenter has also appeared in). The show ran from 2016 to 2019, with a potential new season in the works. The series is said to be in high demand, so we can only assume Carpenter is racking it in.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What's Disney Star Sabrina Carpenter Doing Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-released-39-evolution-39-in-2016><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sabrina Carpenter Released 'Evolution' In 2016</span></h2><p>Her second studio album, Evolution, was released in late 2016. In its first few weeks, the pop dance album sold over 11,500 copies as well as peaked at 28 on Billboards 200. For this album, Carpenter went on two tours to promote it. The “Evolution Tour” in the fall became her first ever headlining tour. The second, “The De-Tour” happened in the summer in the year following.</p><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-39-s-big-screen-debut><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sabrina Carpenter's Big Screen Debut</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite appearing in small projects like Noobz and Horns, Carpenter made her first major big screen performance with the film The Hate U Give. Based on the novel of the same name by Angie Thomas, Carpenter plays ignorant Hailey Grant, school friend to Starr. The film quickly gained critical acclaim and it earned $34 million at the box office. She is also set to star in the film Emergency that is currently in it’s filming stage.</p><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-relased-39-a-singular-act-39-in-2018-amp-2019><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sabrina Carpenter Relased 'A Singular Act' In 2018 & 2019</span></h2><p>Sabrina also released two albums back to back, as she considered them both as a two part project rather than two indivdual pieces. She released Singular: Act I in 2018 and the second album Singular: Act II in 2019. Both albums received positive reviews and debuted on US Billboard 200. She also went on tour once both albums were out, going all over the U.S. and Canada. She also added an Asian leg to her tour, concluding in Singapore in April 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-is-performing-on-the-broadway-stage><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sabrina Carpenter Is Performing On The Broadway Stage</span></h2><p>But it seems that Carpenter is no stranger to combining her talents, as she starred as Cady Heron in the stage musical Mean Girls (based on the film and book of the same name by Tina Fey). This marked her Broadway debut, first appearing center stage in March 2020. However, her limited run was cut short as whole theatres were shut down due to the global pandemic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sabrina Carpenter Teases Her Upcoming Song 'Skinny Dipping' By Literally Doing That And Fans Are Loving It</a></span></p><h2 id=a-streaming-service-veteran><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>A Streaming Service Veteran</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carpenter is also well versed in appearing in films made for streaming services. She appeared in 2019’s Tall Girl as supporting character Harper Kreyman on Netflix. She will also reprise her role in the film’s sequel that is currently in post production. She also starred in Netflix’s dance comedy Work It, which she not only released a single for, but she executive produced the film as well. In its first weekend, the film was the most watched on Netflix. Racking in that Netflix money isn’t enough for her it seems, as the same year, she starred in the musical film Clouds that was released on Disney+. Based on a true story, the song of the same name charted at number 1 for a second time.</p><h2 id=a-new-era-for-sabrina-carpenter><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A New Era For Sabrina Carpenter</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the Joshua Bassett scandal broke, Carpenter released the single “Skin” which debut at number 48 on Billboard 200 and marked the first Carpenter song to enter the Hot 100. Recently, she has also recently released another single, “Skinny Dipping” and has teased her upcoming fifth studio album. Her combined discography currently holds over 1 billion streams on Spotify. And it seems that singing and acting aren’t the only things in her repertoire as Sabrina created her own production company, At Last Productions, in late 2020. This seemed to be a big move as just days after her business was announced, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she sold a pitch for seven figures to Netflix</a>. A modern take on the imaginative world of Alice in Wonderland, Carpenter is set to produce and star in the film. She is also set to star as well as produce for the film adaptation of survival love story The Distance From Me to You by Marina Gessner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard to say for sure whether Sabrina Carpenter has made more money from singing or acting. Her Spotify streams and concert tours have surely brought in the big bucks, but her Disney work certainly brings in hefty paychecks as well.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything Sabrina Carpenter Has Done Since That Olivia Rodrigo Drama</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmpqinruiecKaqamdnqmys3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal50qKloKGenHqir9OipaBllJ7Ar7HYZpyvp5yqwaq7zWaqoqaXqrmivoyamq1lo6C2r3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-lawrence-went-nuts-for-emma-stone-s-win-at-golden-globes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Lawrence Went Nuts for Emma Stone's Win at Golden Globes">&larr;
