But amidst all the controversy surrounding his life right now, he has been making major money moves in various fields of business. From the release of his new album, Donda, on August 29, 2021, to his Yeezy clothing collection, to his Donda Academy high school basketball team - it's no wonder he has one of the highest net worth of $1.8 billion among other rappers, such as <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean ;Diddy' Combs</a> and Jay-Z.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ye is an entrepreneur who has his hands on many things, and one of them is basketball. He launched the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donda</a> Academy earlier in 2021, which he intends to be a prep school that recruits the most talented prospects from across the nation, doing daily routine practices, and keeping up with academics through online learning. On December 23, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported him sitting courtside with fellow rappers <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">French Montana</a> and O.T Genasis at a basketball matchup at Whittier College in California on the night of December 22. Ye was seen chatting with his team players and signing the backs of cell phones for the surrounding fans and college students that flocked the 44-year old rapper.</p><p>The prep school boasts some of the nation's most gifted basketball athletes, such as JJ Taylor, Rob Dillingham, Jahki Howard, and Zion Cruz. But due to the fact that this high school basketball academy is owned by a world-renowned celebrity, resale tickets to the game were sold from $25 to $500. That's not even the price of some professional<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> NBA</a> playoff tickets. His name definitely precedes him wherever he goes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fresh Yeezys: Following The Release of 'Donda', Kanye West Launches New Yeezy Shoes.&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>Ye also showed up to the matchup game in attire that doesn't depict your average basketball coach. No gym sweatpants, no Donda team jersey. He actually sported all black from head to toe and even instructed the fans to do the same. They obeyed Ye's command and were also seen in all-black attire.</p><p>It wasn't much of a coincidence seeing French Montana next to Kanye at the basketball game since he used to date Kim Kardashian's sister, Khloe Kardashian. Montana came as a special guest of the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donda </a>Academy Doves. Besides attending the basketball game to view from the sidelines, Montana was also spotted gifting Kanye a special edition pair of Air Jordan 3 "Coke Boy L.A Ave" edition sneakers. But as a part of his all-black dress code, he sports either Balenciaga or how own Yeezy Apparel boots. It's clear to see that, despite his turbulence with his relationship with his wife, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a>, he is still enjoying the fruit of his investments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Kanye West Drums Up Million At Donda'e This Event, Before Album Even Drops</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=#> TMZ, </a><a href=#>Thirsty For News</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4orrYnmSeppqkxrR5x6KqZpyfo7GiecOorZ6rXZ28rrHCqKSippdiwaatzGakmqyTncKxedaiq6FlpJ6wrLHTZqmeq5GhsrR50ZqloKGenHqnvs6mZGttXam8boGPaWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michael-jackson-answered-to-rumors-he-chose-a-white-child-to-play-a-younger-version-of-him-in-a-peps.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Jackson Answered To Rumors He Chose A White Child To Play A Younger Version Of Him In A Peps">&larr;
