This show features two teen boys who are already trying to navigate life in school, but also start to realize that their feelings of friendship may be shifting into something more. As a teen romance, coming of age miniseries, the producers stayed true to their goals in casting. Here is the cast of Heartstopper ranked by net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Reddit Is Divided By Netflix's Comic-Turned-TV-Series 'Heartstopper'</a></span></p><h2 id=tobie-donovan-isaac-has-a-100-000-net-worth><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Tobie Donovan (Isaac) Has A $100,000 Net Worth</span></h2><p>Tobie Donovan was hired to play the role of “Isaac Henderson” in this television series. He is a beginner in Hollywood, and Heartstopper is officially the first (and as of now—only) credit on his resume. Donovan is represented by Independent Talent Group, which is an agency based in London. Because of how much traction his show picked up, Tobie's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth is currently at $1K</a>.</p><h2 id=william-gao-tao-has-an-estimated-net-worth-of-100-000><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>William Gao (Tao) Has An Estimated Net Worth Of $100,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>William Gao embodies “Tao Xu” in the show, and it may surprise viewers to know that he has no previous acting experience. He is, however, part of a musical group called Wasia Project in which he plays the keyboard and lends background vocals. Because of this success, Gao has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of approximately $100,000</a>.</p><h2 id=yasmin-finney-elle-is-worth-approx-200-000><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Yasmin Finney (Elle) Is Worth Approx. $200,000</span></h2><p>Yasmin Finney has not only been in every Heartstopper episode as “Elle Argent,” but she has since been hired to appear on Doctor Who for an episode that will air in 2023. Besides Hollywood entertainment, Finney is well known on social media as an influencer, both on Instagram and on Tiktok. Both platforms have boosted her standing and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth to rest at around $200,000</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Darren Criss And Other Straight Actors Have Said About Playing Gay Roles</a></span></p><h2 id=joe-locke-charlie-has-a-2-6k-net-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Joe Locke (Charlie) Has A $2-6K Net Worth</span></h2><p>Although Joe Locke, who plays “Charlie Spring” on the series, is one of the main characters, his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth is currently between $200,000 and $600,000</a>. This star is brand-new to onscreen acting with Heartstopper as his first and only filmography credit. His show was just announced to be picked up for two more seasons, so we will be seeing more of Locke on our screens in the next few years.</p><h2 id=cormac-hyde-corrin-harry-has-approximately-500-000><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Cormac Hyde-Corrin (Harry) Has Approximately $500,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much like the rest of the cast, Cormac Hyde-Corrin is new to acting. He was cast as “Harry Greene” in this series, but his desire is to be a film director. Cormac does not have experience yet, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is attending a school in Great Britain</a> to obtain a diploma in film and media production. With all the work he has put in, his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth has come to half a million dollars</a>.</p><h2 id=rhea-norwood-imogen-has-a-net-worth-of-2-3-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rhea Norwood (Imogen) Has A Net Worth Of $2-3 Million</span></h2><p>“Imogen Heaney” is played by Rhea Norwood. Heartstopper is her first acting credit, but she has also been cast in an upcoming short called Kill Them with Kindness which is set to premier later this year. Norwood is a proud member of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and is also represented by the Independent Talent Group (like her costar Tobie Donovan), bringing her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth to approximately $2-3 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Stanley Tucci Struggles With The Controversy Of Straight Actors Playing Gay Roles</a></span></p><h2 id=sebastian-croft-ben-is-worth-approx-4-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sebastian Croft (Ben) Is Worth Approx. $4 Million</span></h2><p>Sebastian Croft has been cast as “Ben Hope” for this series. He is one of the few actors who came into the show with previous onscreen experience, as he has played eleven roles prior to the Heartstopper release, including two episodes of Game of Thrones. Croft also has two movies that are completed and will come out later this year, bringing his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth to $4 million</a>.</p><h2 id=kit-connor-nick-has-a-5-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kit Connor (Nick) Has A $5 Million Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kit Connor is the second main character of the show, playing the role of “Nick Nelson.” He began acting in 2013 and has added over 20 credits to his filmography, including big names like the movies Rocketman, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and Ready Player One. All the work he put into these titles has raised his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth to $5 million</a>.</p><h2 id=olivia-colman-sarah-has-a-net-worth-of-8-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Olivia Colman (Sarah) Has A Net Worth Of $8 Million</span></h2><p>The most accomplished actor on the Heartstopper cast list is Olivia Colman, who plays “Sarah Nelson.” This English star has been in over 120 productions, <a href=#>including </a><a href=#>The Crown</a>, Murder on the Orient Express, and all the Thomas & Friends spin-off shows and movies. She also has eight projects currently in the works. Her immaculate performances have given her a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $8 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Did 'Heartstopper' Land Oscar Winner Olivia Colman In A Supporting Role?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmK60wIyonWamlamzrbXXrGShnZGnwbTAzqmnnqpdp66vt8SdZJuxXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tina-turner-s-most-fierce-fashion-moments-of-all-time-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tina Turners Most Fierce Fashion Moments of All Time: Photos">&larr;
