There was even <a href=#>talk recently of a reboot, which she is totally on board with</a>. But she was more than a demon-vampire slayer during this time. It seemed like she was in everything, tbh. Her busy filming schedule in the late '90s got her into Scream 2 without even reading the script.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cruel Intentions (1999) as Kathryn Merteuil and Scooby-Doo (2002) are both iconic Sarah Michelle Gellar roles as well. She also starred in one of the scariest movies of its time, The Gudge (2004). Such a creepy film as well as a huge success; they made Part 2, and she was in that as well.</p><p>These days, you can see her in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf Pack on Paramount</a>, married to Freddie Prinze Jr., and a mother of two.</p><h2 id=iconic-39-90s-horror-movie-actor-matthew-lillard><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Iconic '90s Horror Movie Actor: Matthew Lillard</span></h2><h3 id=most-popular-39-90s-horror-movie-scream-1996>Most Popular '90s Horror Movie: Scream (1996)</h3><h3><img alt="matthew lillard" data-image-id=245685 height=628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matthew-lillard.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center width=1200></h3><ul><li><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Where To Watch Scream:</strong> Max</a></li><li><strong>Other Horror Movies Starred In: </strong>Thirteen Ghosts (2001), Dead Man's Curve (1998), Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go To College (1991), and coming soon, Five Nights At Freddy's</li><li><strong>Net Worth: </strong>$2 Million</li><li><strong>Current Age</strong>: 53</li></ul><p>Matthew Lillard has gained a reputation for his eccentric, comical, and passionate portrayals.
