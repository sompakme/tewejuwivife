Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=guy-fieri-39-s-diet>Guy Fieri's Diet</h2><p>Besides wondering about <a href=#>Guy Fieri's real hair</a>, the food personality is famous for the dishes that he eats on his popular Food Network show since the food is often very rich and indulgent.</p><p>As it turns out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy Fieri eats healthier</a> than people might assume based on the kind of junk food that he often consumes on Diners, Drive-Ins And Dives. According to Delish.com, he enjoys vegetables and salads.</p><p>It sounds like Guy Fieri is super close with his family and he and his wife, Lori, are total foodies who enjoy cooking and eating together. Guy and Lori have two sons, 25-year-old Hunter and 15-year-old Ryder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Guy talked about his marriage with Today.com and shared that his wife loves when he makes a pasta dish. He said, "My linguini and clams is probably one of her all-time favorites. Especially when the clams are really small. And when we sit down together to have a really nice dinner."</p><p>Guy Fieri also shared with Today.com that Lori makes an amazing dish that he loves, and it's sweet to hear that she cooks for him, too. The star said, "There's an old school recipe she makes that she brought home from where she grew up in Rhode Island. It's one of the first things she ever cooked for me and it's still a favorite of mine." Guy shared that its "top sirloin with onions, mushrooms and garlic" with egg noodles and a gravy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Guy also shared with the publication that his family does have some fun foods but they definitely eat healthy at home: "We indulge from time to time but for the most part, we eat well-balanced, often very plant-based meals."</p><p>It sounds like Lori is super supportive of Guy as, according to Mashed.com, Lori wanted Guy to compete on The Next Food Network Star when he was given the chance. Since he was in charge of three restaurants and they were expecting their second baby, he didn't think that it was a good time, but Lori said he had to give it a shot.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are Questioning If Chef Ramsay Really Took A Dig At Guy Fieri</a></span></p><h2 id=guy-and-lori>Guy And Lori</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Delish.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy Fieri talked about his family</a> and said that they mean so much to him.

Lori was there to visit a friend of hers, and Guy could tell that he wanted to be with her. In a romantic story, Guy said that he made Lori a meal and that was that for them. He said, "I don't remember what I made, but I do remember it was quite an epic time. The first time I cooked for her, she was just like, 'You made all this?' We both love food, so being able to cook, that was one of the things that impressed her."</p><p>After getting married in 1993, Guy and Lori had their two sons in 1996 and 2005, and they definitely seem to be very happy together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lori has joked that she would love for Guy to switch up his hairstyle, as his hair was black when they were first dating, and according to People, his style was different as he would wear suits.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Guy Fieri Has Officiated 'Over 100 Weddings'</a></span></p><p>It makes sense that people are super curious about Guy Fieri's diet and it's no wonder that this question comes up a lot when he's interviewed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star told Variety that he really isn't into eating fried food and that he's careful with portion sizes. He said, "I’m not a huge fried food fan myself. Personally, I’m a big vegetable fan and I have to be very cautious of what I eat and how much I eat of it.
