Regardless, there are still rumors and speculations about whom the star is seen with. Her ambiguous friendship with singer/songwriter Charlie Puth still gets people talking about what really went on between the two.</p><p>This is not new to Selena; she was in a relationship with The Weekend, <a href=#>which spurred a song from the artist</a>. However, Selena’s on-again-off-again relationship with <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> was the most talked about. While the singer keeps quiet about her relationships, she is not above sharing her experiences through her <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a>—she is a musician, after all. So, is her song “Single Soon” about her rumored relationship with Charlie Puth?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-was-rumored-to-have-dated-charlie-puth-in-2016>Selena Gomez Was Rumored To Have Dated Charlie Puth In 2016</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/untitled-design-76.jpg><p>Buzz about Selena Gomez and Charlie began to surface in 2016 after Puth released the breakup song, "We Don't Talk Anymore," featuring vocals from Selena Gomez. The song was a hit and sparked rumors after paparazzi sighted the celebs together.</p><p>There were no official reports from the two parties at that time, and they maintained their ‘good friends’ title in public.</p><p>However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Puth revealed a bit about his rumored relationship</a> in his 2018 interview with Billboard. “I don’t kiss and tell, but the only way a song like that can come across as real is if there’s something else going on behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/charlie-puth-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Are Convinced Charlie Puth Made These Off-Color Comments About Selena Gomez</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While neither has ever confirmed any romance rumors, fans are convinced that Charlie Puth's comments may have been aimed at Selena Gomez.</span><p>“And that’s what was happening [with Gomez]. Very short-lived, very small, but very impactful. And it really messed me up. I’m trying to put this the best way possible: It wasn’t like I was the only person on her mind. And I think I knew that going in — what I was getting myself into,” he said.</p><p>On the other hand, Selena never confirmed the rumors. Instead, a source close to her told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE magazine that the two never dated</a>.</p><h2 id=did-charlie-puth-sing-about-selena-gomez>Did Charlie Puth Sing About Selena Gomez?</h2><p>Charlie Puth may not have forthrightly said it, but it was insinuated that his songs “Attention” and “That’s Hilarious” are about Selena Gomez.</p><p>When Charlie released "That’s Hilarious" in 2022, the “See You Again” singer did not reveal who the song was about. However, he did mention the piece was about a dark time in his life concerning a relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“That’s Hilarious” is about his worst breakup, according to the singer. Charlie never mentioned who the song was about, but <a href=#>fans speculated it was about his short-lived relationship with Selena</a>.</p><p>Puth not correcting people about their speculations on who was responsible for the emotions he felt when writing the song only made them speculate further, trying to piece the clues to what really happened between the two.</p><p>“That’s Hilarious” may not have been about Selena, but Charlie Puth may have been willing to ignite the rumors about him and the “Lose You to Love Me” singer with his single “Attention.”</p><p>"Attention" was released in 2017, and the lyrics described the tumultuous relationship with a woman stringing him along, then breaking his heart. Charlie never confirmed anything about the relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, on March 25, 2023, the singer took to Twitter/X to announce in a now-deleted tweet that the song was about who people thought it was about. He didn't say more, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he did receive backlash for stirring up old dating rumors with Selena</a> years after both parted ways.</p><h2 id=selena-39-s-song-quot-single-soon-quot-might-be-about-charlie-puth>Selena's Song "Single Soon" Might Be About Charlie Puth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/selena-gomez-single-soon.jpg><p>It may seem Selena Gomez is trying to say something about what went on between her and Charlie Puth.

Now I can relate to it," Selena wrote as a footnote.</p><p>As the title says, "Single Soon" is about what comes after a breakup, with savage remarks on how to break the breakup news. The lyrics also hint at expected freedom, which means Selena is not remorseful about it.</p><p>"Single Soon" does not call any exact situations or names, but the fact that it was written the year when Charlie and Selena were linked together suggests the song may be directed at that era.</p><p>From Charlie's speculated songs about the time to being broken-hearted and Selena's song insinuating she broke a heart without remorse, it could only mean the two may be referring to this short-lived romance they never openly acknowledged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHbsPRoqueZZFiwLC6xmaYm6elqXqktMCro6KdXaXCtbSO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./django-s-watches-a-peek-inside-jamie-foxx-s-splendid-watch-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Django's Watches: A Peek Inside Jamie Foxx's Splendid Watch Collection">&larr;
