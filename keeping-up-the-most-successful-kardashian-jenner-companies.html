Almost every member of this family has their legacy. Of course, the most notable of them is <a href=#>the queen bee Kim Kardashian</a> whose net worth is a jaw-dropping $1 billion. Next comes the 23-year-old Kylie Jenner, who, with her mind-blowing $700 million net worth, is the youngest self-made billionaire. <a href=#>Kris Kardashian</a>, Khloé , Kourtney, and Kendall are multi-millionaires.</p><p>Here are the most successful Kardashian-Jenner companies.</p><h2 id=dash-by-kourtney-kim-and-khlo-kardashian>DASH by Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé Kardashian</h2><p>DASH was a venture by the trio Kourtney, Khloe, and Kris. It is a boutique based in Calabasas, California, established in 2006, as stated by <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Parenting Tips Kourtney Uses To Raise Her Kids That The Other Kardashians Should Follow</a></span></p><p>It turns out Kim is not the only one who knows how to take advantage of the fame the Kardashian-Jenner's earned with their reality TV show, and it runs in the family. In fact, it is reported that Kim told the press that she wanted to use the fame they earned to make their business thrive.</p><h2 id=jenner-communications-by-kris-jenner>Jenner Communications By Kris Jenner</h2><p><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> runs a company called Jenner Communications which is all about offering internships to young students. Being a mother herself, she might have realized the necessity of letting the young ones have a touch of job life from an early stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been some complaints about these internships being part-time and unpaid. Although unpaid internships don't work out even for college students, nobody would possibly pass up a chance of interning with the Jenner's. The company valuation is estimated to be $190 million.</p><h2 id=hollywood-video-game-and-kimoji-keyboard-by-kim-kardashian>Hollywood Video Game and Kimoji Keyboard by Kim Kardashian</h2><p>Kim is aware of how fans crave to unearth the secrets of her glamorous life. To satiate their hunger, she came up with an innovative game called Hollywood Video Game based on how a newbie in Hollywood can become a socialite. This game had been viral ever since it first got launched.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim might not be a generation Z like Kylie, but she sure knows how to play her game. Sometime back, she launched the Kimoji keyboard, which was a brilliant idea to spice up the regular emojis by adding<a href=#> a Kim Kardashian touch</a>. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, it was made specifically for Apple users and could be purchased from the Apple store for about $1.99.</p><h2 id=good-american-by-khloe-kardashian>Good American By Khloe Kardashian</h2><p>Khloe is considered by many to be the "nicest" of the Kardashians and also the one most wronged by her romantic partner, Tristan Thompson. But that is not the only trivia about Khloe that one should be familiar with, as her success story is truly inspiring.</p><p>She is the founder of the clothing brand called Good American, which is mainly known for its all-inclusive products. Khloe made sure that this brand caters to women of all sizes. It reportedly has an estimated income of $3.6 million per year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=skims-by-kim-kardashian>SKIMS by Kim Kardashian</h2><p>SKIMS is just one of the many successful businesses that <a href=#>Kim Kardashian owns</a>. This is one of her most recent ventures, and the name is so because the star wanted her name to be part of the company's name.</p><p>However, when SKIMS was named ''Kimono'' initially, it faced some backlash in appropriating Japanese culture. Currently, it is a successful brand that sells shapewear for women of all ages and sizes. The company is estimated to have an evaluation of $1.6 billion.</p><h2 id=kylie-cosmetics-and-kylie-skin-by-kylie-jenner>Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin By Kylie Jenner</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is much limelight on Kylie Jenner in the Kardashian-Jenner family because she is the world’s youngest billionaire. Although the Kardashian-Jenner's like to stick together and be there for each other, Kylie is an excellent competition to her sisters even by those standards.</p><p>When <a href=#>Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin was launched</a> in 2014, the star had just become an adult. Ever since she has proven to know her market well and is aware that fans constantly eye her flawless skin and hair. Today her business has a value of over $900 million, and it is not difficult to understand how or why.</p><h2 id=kkw-beauty-by-kim-kardashian>KKW Beauty by Kim Kardashian</h2><p>KKW Beauty by Kim Kardashian was launched back in the year 2017. Given that Kim is already a role model and the epitome of beauty for so many women worldwide, her products were instantly hit. The company is currently worth over $1 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>, Kim knew which demographic to target and was smart enough to make older women and particularly adults, her target consumers. It worked out in her favor as, with age, insecurities related to beauty and glamour may weigh high. Kim Kardashian is the epitome of looking perfect even in one’s middle age, and it was like a ray of hope for her customers.</p><p>When the <a href=#>Kardashian-Jenner</a> way is referred to as a whole new lifestyle, it throws light on the degree of influence this family has on the world at large. The beauty ideals set by the model cum celebrity stars of this dynasty have taken the internet by storm. This is also the secret behind such great popularity of their business endeavors.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Richest Rappers In The World, 2021</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6sL%2FTZqqum5OawLSy1KVkpJmima60tMiapWailaO7pr6MnKamqJGjtqa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lisa-kudrow-says-she-became-friends-phoebe-buffay-because-no-one-else-could-handle-the-audition.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lisa Kudrow Says She Became Friends' Phoebe Buffay Because No One Else Could Handle The Audition">&larr;
