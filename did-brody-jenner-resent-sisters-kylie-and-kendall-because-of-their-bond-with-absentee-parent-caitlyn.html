However, as Kendall and Kylie Jenner rose to untouchable fame, their dynamic changed, <a href=#>especially after Kris's separation from Caitlyn</a> in October 2013.</p><p>Over the years, Brody Jenner has hinted that he doesn't have the closest relationship with Kendall and Kylie Jenner.

But things changed after Kris and Caitlyn Jenner's ex-partner split in 2013. In 2018, after Kylie had her daughter Stormi, Brody was honest with TMZ. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He said he didn't even know Kylie was pregnant</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Kris Jenner Orchestrate Kylie Jenner And Timothee Chalamet's Relationship As A Last Ditch Attempt To Boost Her Relevance?</a></span></p><p>But now that he knows, he wants to meet the baby.

He said he doesn't see the Kardashians much anymore. They all have their own lives since his dad and Kris split up. He acknowledged that they're all busy and live far apart, but he emphasized that they're still close.</p><p>Back when their TV show started, Brody and Brandon sometimes appeared. But they officially joined the cast in season 7.

Brody and Brandon still support the Jenners and Kardashians, even if they don't see each other much. They live in the same area, so they might run into each other sometimes. They're not as close as when Kendall and Kylie were younger, but that's how life goes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2023, people criticized Kylie and Kendall for not attending Brody's baby shower and engagement event.
