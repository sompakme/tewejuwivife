In the following, we're going to take a look back at Gosling's NYC encounter with two men, and it was all caught on video.</p><p>Gosling was praised for stopping the fight but as it turns out, Ryan regretted the situation given the context of what was taking place.

The fight starts with just the two "dudes," and then later, Gosling shows up in a tank top to save the day. Now Gosling did comment on the moment, stating that he regretted it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, fans had nothing but praise for the actor stepping in. It was yet another moment that showed how humble the man really is.

Gosling gave a little more context to the situation, and it was said that an artist had his painting stolen by a person that had been admiring it for quite some time.</p><p>Gosling states that he should've just stayed out of it and let them deal with it on their own.

It's a new kind of film language that I'm not really adept at."</p><p>Gosling's role in the film was a misfire, and <a href=#>it received loud boos at Cannes</a>.

But also I was directing a film at the time, so it was like “Sophie’s Choice,” you know? Because you’d have to leave halfway through the shoot in the middle of a shoot week to go to Cannes. It was like a “Sophie’s Choice” situation."</p><p>We can safely say that Gosling made the right choice...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipspmeYrSwv8uipaBlkqeyorfIp55mraBirm6yyKCfrWWZo3qvxcJmoKxlkaO8tbTEq2SesJGiva2xjJqqZqyfYsSpxYyhnKxln6OybrvFZquhnV2jtqSx0q1koK2pqHqquoyhpqWkqay8sLCO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sean-kingston-had-open-heart-surgery-following-jet-ski-crash.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sean Kingston Had Open-Heart Surgery Following Jet Ski Crash">&larr;
