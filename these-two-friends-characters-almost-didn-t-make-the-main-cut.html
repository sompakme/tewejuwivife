Of course, one of the main factors of the show that draws everyone in is the main characters and the relationship between the main cast both on and off-screen.</p><p>However, the show could have looked entirely different had the original plans for the main characters gone ahead.

Given that the entire show revolved around those six characters and their relationships with one another and other people, it doesn't appear to work in any other way.</p><p>However, there was one scenario that could have caused the show to be seen in an entirely different light. This was to only focus on four main characters in the form of Rachel, Joey, Ross, and Monica, and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends creators wanted to make Phoebe and Chandler recurring characters</a> instead.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-31t121619-913.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The One Friends Episode That Was Banned In The UK Because Of Matthew Perry And Matt LeBlanc">The One Friends Episode That Was Banned In The UK Because Of Matthew Perry And Matt LeBlanc</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A storyline featuring Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry on Friends during season 4 was viewed as too much by some countries.</p><p>As <a href=#>Warner Bros was threatening to fire two Friends cast members during contract negotiations</a> when they wanted an equal and fair raise, perhaps it was <a href=#><strong>Matthew Perry</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></a> they were planning on firing?</p><p>It isn't known who they were planning on firing, but according to <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>, they had threatened to fire two of the main cast as a way of cutting costs (which thankfully the cast called their bluff on).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that Chandler and Phoebe were the characters who were originally only meant to be recurring parts might come as quite a shock to fans.</p><p>Chandler's iconic one-liners and Phoebe's quirkiness meant there was no way the show could have happened without them at the center of it, as they're part of the reason why fans can relate to the show so much.</p><p>Even though there were still some other iconic recurring characters on Friends, such as Gunther and Mike, there is no way that fans could even bear the thought of any of the main cast being made recurring characters instead, because it was the on-screen chemistry between all six of them that made the show what it is.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-one-friends-question-matthew-perry-told-an-interviewer-to-stop-asking-during-their-candid-conversation.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The One Friends Question Matthew Perry Told An Interviewer To Stop Asking During Their Candid Conversation">The One Friends Question Matthew Perry Told An Interviewer To Stop Asking During Their Candid Conversation</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The interviewer asked Matthew Perry one too many questions about Friends, but he handled it in the best way possible.</p><p>It's not known why this decision was made or whether the creators had first decided to go with the six characters, then gone down to four, and then finally decided that the six characters were the better option, but what is sure is that fans will be glad that this is the decision that they stuck with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=other-famous-actors-were-considered-for-the-main-39-friends-39-characters>Other Famous Actors Were Considered For The Main 'Friends' Characters</h2><p>Whilst fans find that one of the best things about Friends is that the actors who played the main characters got on so well, as with any TV show, many actors auditioned for the main roles in Friends, to the point where we could have seen an entirely different cast on our TV screens.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_cole-sprouse-is-still-earning-good-money-from-friends-today_bk_a3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Cole Sprouse Is Still Earning Good Money From Friends Today">Cole Sprouse Is Still Earning Good Money From Friends Today</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Cole Sprouse may not have been on 'Friends' for long, but he appears to still be getting paid from those appearances today.</p><p>One of these people is Kristin Davis.

While he didn't quite get the role, fans would have seen him on the show playing the role of Carl who was Joey's fake twin and fans got to see a little glimpse at what Joey without <a href=#><strong>Matt LeBlanc</strong></a> would look like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, actors who auditioned for the main roles on Friends but didn't quite make the mark seem to be a theme as others had auditioned for one of these roles but ended up being cast in a smaller, sometimes recurring, role on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pivot-friends-ross-chandler-rachel-screenshot-youtube-1.jpg><p>One of these is Hank Azaria, who many fans of Friends will recognize as having played David (Phoebe's love interest who moves to Minsk and who she almost ended up with instead of Mike).
