Olly Murs also surprised fans with his sick vocals, however, the singer lost the title out to winner, Joe McElderry. Olly not only went on to release music for his millions of UK fans, but he became the face of the series!</p><p>The star went on to work closely with ITV where he stood in as the host of the show alongside Caroline Flack. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olly also landed a spot on The Voice</a>, where he sat in as a coach.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bea-miller><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bea Miller</span></h2><p>Bea Miller made a name for herself on the second season of The X Factor where she soared through the competition in the Teens category, which was mentored by former judge, Britney Spears.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Has Harry Styles Changed Since X-Factor?</a></span></p><p>Although she didn't take home the win, Bea went on to have a successful career in the United States, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">releasing two EP's</a> and an album back in 2018, which included hit songs, 'feel something' and 'like that', to name a few.</p><h2 id=restless-road><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Restless Road</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Restless Road came to prominence back in The X Factor's final season in the United States.
